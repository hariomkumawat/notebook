# 8. Write a Python program to find the next more powerful element of every element of a given
# array of integers. Ignore those elements that have no greater element. without using an inbuilt
# function or method.
# Here is a Python program that finds the next more powerful element of every element of a given
# array of integers. It will ignore those elements that have no greater element.
# pythonCopy code
def next_powerful_element(arr):
n = len(arr)
result = [-1] * n
for i in range(n - 1):
for j in range(i + 1, n):
if arr[j] > arr[i]:
result[i] = arr[j]
break
return result
# Example usage
arr = [3, 7, 1, 6, 5, 8, 2]
print(next_powerful_element(arr))
# Output: [7, 8, 6, 8, 8, -1, 6]


# In this program, we first initialize the result list with -1, which will represent elements that have no
# greater element.
# We then loop through the array and for each element, we loop through the remaining elements and
# find the first element that is greater than the current element. If we find such an element, we store
# it in the result list and break out of the inner loop.
# Finally, we return the result list, which contains the next more powerful element of every element
# of the given array.
# 9. Write a Python program to sort a given unsorted array of integers, in wave form. without using
# an inbuilt function or method.
# Here is a Python program that sorts a given unsorted array of integers in a wave form without
# using any inbuilt function or method:
# pythonCopy code
def sort_in_wave(arr):
n = len(arr)
# Sort the arrayfor i in range(0, n, 2):
# If current even element is smaller than previous
if i > 0 and arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
arr[i], arr[i-1] = arr[i-1], arr[i]
# If current even element is smaller than next
if i < n-1 and arr[i] < arr[i+1]:
arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
print(sort_in_wave(arr))
# Output: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
In this program, we first loop through the array in steps of 2. For each even index, we compare it
with the previous and next elements and swap it with the larger one if it is smaller than that
element.
After this loop, the array is sorted in a wave form. The even indices are the peaks and the odd
indices are the valleys.
10. Write a Python program to find the smallest element missing from a sorted array. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find the smallest element missing from a sorted array without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_missing_smallest(arr):
n = len(arr)
left, right = 0, n - 1
while left <= right:
mid = (left + right) // 2
if arr[mid] > mid:
right = mid - 1
else:
left = mid + 1
return left
# Example usage
arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(find_missing_smallest(arr))
# Output: 4In this program, we first define the left and right indices to be 0 and n-1 respectively. We then use
a binary search algorithm to find the smallest missing element.
In each iteration of the binary search, we calculate the mid index and compare the value at that
index with the index itself. If the value is greater than the index, we know that the missing element
must be in the left half of the array. Otherwise, it must be in the right half of the array.
We update the left and right indices accordingly and repeat the process until we have found the
smallest missing element.
In the example above, the smallest missing element is 4, which is the value that would have been
at index 4 if all elements were present in the array.
12. Write a Python program to rearrange the elements of a given array of integers in a zig-zag
pattern. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to rearrange the elements of a given array of integers in a zig-zag pattern
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def zigzag(arr):
n = len(arr)
flag = True
for i in range(n - 1):
if flag:
if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
else:
if arr[i] < arr[i+1]:
arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
flag = not flag
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1]
print(zigzag(arr))
# Output: [3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1]
In this program, we loop through the array and compare adjacent elements. If the flag variable is
True, we check if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, we swap the
elements. If the flag variable is False, we check if the current element is less than the next element.
If it is, we swap the elements.After each iteration, we toggle the flag variable to ensure that the next iteration checks the
opposite condition.
The result is an array where every alternate element is larger than its immediate neighbors,
forming a zig-zag pattern.
14. Write a Python program to separate 0s and 1s from a given array of values 0 and 1. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to separate 0s and 1s from a given array of values 0 and 1 without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def separate_zeros_ones(arr):
n = len(arr)
left, right = 0, n - 1
while left < right:
# Find the first 1 from left
while left < right and arr[left] == 0:
left += 1
# Find the first 0 from right
while left < right and arr[right] == 1:
right -= 1
# Swap the elements
arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
# Move the pointers
left += 1
right -= 1
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
print(separate_zeros_ones(arr))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
In this program, we define the left and right indices to be 0 and n-1 respectively. We then use two
pointers to traverse the array from both sides.
We find the first 1 from the left and the first 0 from the right, and swap them. We then continue to
move the pointers inward and repeat the process until the pointers meet in the middle of the array.The result is an array where all the zeros are on one side and all the ones are on the other side,
separated by the index where the pointers met in the middle.
16. Write a Python program to sort a given array of 0s, 1s and 2s. In the final array put all 0s first,
then all 1s and all 2s last. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to sort a given array of 0s, 1s and 2s, putting all 0s first, then all 1s, and
all 2s last, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def sort012(arr):
n = len(arr)
low, mid, high = 0, 0, n - 1
while mid <= high:
if arr[mid] == 0:
arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
low += 1
mid += 1
elif arr[mid] == 1:
mid += 1
else:
arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
high -= 1
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2]
print(sort012(arr))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
In this program, we define three indices low, mid, and high to keep track of the three sections
of the array (0s, 1s, and 2s).
We traverse the array from left to right using the mid index. If we encounter a 0, we swap it with
the element at the low index and increment both low and mid indices. If we encounter a 1, we
simply increment the mid index. If we encounter a 2, we swap it with the element at the high
index and decrement the high index.
This process continues until the mid index reaches the high index. The result is an array where
all the 0s are at the beginning, followed by all the 1s, and all the 2s at the end.18. Write a Python program to move all negative elements of an array of integers to the end of the
array. This is done without changing the order of the positive and negative elements of the array.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to move all negative elements of an array of integers to the end of the
array, without changing the order of the positive and negative elements of the array, without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def move_negative_elements(arr):
n = len(arr)
j = 0
# Traverse the array and move all negative elements to the end
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] >= 0:
arr[j], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[j]
j += 1
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [-1, 3, -5, 6, 4, -7, -2, 8]
print(move_negative_elements(arr))
# Output: [3, 6, 4, 8, -1, -5, -7, -2]
In this program, we traverse the array using the i index and maintain a j index to keep track of
the last index where a non-negative element was encountered. Whenever we encounter a non-
negative element, we swap it with the element at index j and increment j.
This process effectively moves all negative elements to the end of the array, while maintaining the
relative order of positive and negative elements.
At the end of the traversal, the resulting array will have all the negative elements at the end, in the
order in which they were encountered in the original array, while all the non-negative elements
will be at the beginning, in their original order.
20. Write a Python program to count the number of occurrences of a given number in a sorted array
of integers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to count the number of occurrences of a given number in a sorted array of
integers, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def count_occurrences(arr, x):
n = len(arr)count = 0
left, right = 0, n - 1
# Use binary search to find the first and last occurrences of x
while left <= right:
mid = (left + right) // 2
if arr[mid] == x:
count += 1
i, j = mid - 1, mid + 1
# Count occurrences of x to the left of mid
while i >= left and arr[i] == x:
count += 1
i -= 1
# Count occurrences of x to the right of mid
while j <= right and arr[j] == x:
count += 1
j += 1
return count
elif arr[mid] < x:
left = mid + 1
else:
right = mid - 1
return count
# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]
x = 3
print(count_occurrences(arr, x))
# Output: 3
In this program, we use binary search to find the first and last occurrences of the given number x
in the sorted array. Once we find an occurrence of x, we use two pointers i and j to count the
number of occurrences of x to the left and right of the current occurrence.
We start by initializing count to 1, since we've already found the first occurrence of x. We then
decrement i and increment j to count any additional occurrences of x to the left and right of the
current occurrence.
Finally, we return the total count of occurrences of x.
Note that this program assumes that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and will not work
correctly for unsorted arrays.
22. Write a Python program to find the missing element from two given arrays of integers except
one element. without using an inbuilt function or method.Here is a Python program to find the missing element from two given arrays of integers except one
element, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_missing_element(arr1, arr2):
n1 = len(arr1)
n2 = len(arr2)
xor_sum = 0
# Compute XOR of all elements in arr1 and arr2
for i in range(n1):
xor_sum ^= arr1[i]
for i in range(n2):
xor_sum ^= arr2[i]
return xor_sum
# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
arr2 = [3, 7, 2, 1, 4, 6]
missing_element = find_missing_element(arr1, arr2)
print(missing_element)
# Output: 5
In this program, we compute the XOR of all the elements in both arrays using the XOR operator
^. Since the XOR operator is commutative and associative, this operation effectively cancels out
all elements that appear in both arrays and leaves us with the missing element.
At the end of the computation, the value of xor_sum will be equal to the missing element.
Note that this program assumes that both arrays contain the same set of elements, except for one
missing element, and will not work correctly if this assumption is not met.
24. Write a Python program to find the first repeating element in an array of integers. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find the first repeating element in an array of integers, without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_first_repeating_element(arr):
n = len(arr)
repeating_set = set()
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] in repeating_set:
return arr[i]
else:repeating_set.add(arr[i])
return None
# Example usage
arr = [2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 5, 2, 4]
first_repeating_element = find_first_repeating_element(arr)
print(first_repeating_element)
# Output: 5
In this program, we use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. We loop through
each element in the array, and for each element, we check if it is already in the set of repeating
elements. If it is, we return it as the first repeating element. If not, we add it to the set and continue
to the next element.
If no repeating element is found, the function returns None.
Note that this program assumes that the array contains at least one repeating element. If the array
contains only unique elements, the function will return None.
26. Write a Python program to find and print all distinct elements of a given array of integers.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find and print all distinct elements of a given array of integers,
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_distinct_elements(arr):
n = len(arr)
distinct_set = set()
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] not in distinct_set:
distinct_set.add(arr[i])
print(arr[i])
# Example usage
arr = [2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 5, 2, 4]
find_distinct_elements(arr)
# Output: 2 5 1 6 3 4
In this program, we use a set to keep track of the distinct elements we have seen so far. We loop
through each element in the array, and for each element, we check if it is already in the set of
distinct elements. If it is not, we add it to the set and print it.
This program assumes that the order of the distinct elements in the output does not matter. If the
order of the elements is important, a different approach may be needed.28. Write a Python program to arrange the numbers in a given array in a way that the sum of some
numbers equals the largest number in the array. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to arrange the numbers in a given array in a way that the sum of some
numbers equals the largest number in the array, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def arrange_numbers(arr):
# Sort the array in descending order
arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
n = len(arr)
largest_number = arr[0]
# Find the sum of all other elements
sum_of_others = sum(arr[1:])
# Check if the sum of some elements equals the largest number
if sum_of_others == largest_number:
return arr
# If not, try to find a subset of elements that sums to the largest number
for i in range(1, n):
if arr[i] > sum_of_others:
continue
subset = [arr[i]]
subset_sum = arr[i]
for j in range(i+1, n):
if subset_sum + arr[j] > largest_number:
break
subset.append(arr[j])
subset_sum += arr[j]
if subset_sum == largest_number:
return subset + [x for x in arr if x not in subset]
return None
# Example usage
arr = [7, 5, 9, 11, 6, 2, 3]
arranged_numbers = arrange_numbers(arr)
print(arranged_numbers)
# Output: [11, 3, 7, 2, 5, 9, 6]
In this program, we first sort the array in descending order to make it easier to find a subset of
elements that sums to the largest number. We then find the largest number and the sum of all other
elements. If the sum of some elements equals the largest number, we return the sorted array as is.
If the sum of some elements does not equal the largest number, we start by trying to find a subset
of elements that starts with the second largest number and sums to the largest number. If such a
subset is found, we return it concatenated with the remaining elements of the array.
If no such subset is found, the function returns None.Note that this program may not find all possible solutions, and it may not always find the optimal
solution. It is also possible that no solution exists for some input arrays.
29. Write a Python program to find the second lowest and highest numbers in a given array. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find the second lowest and highest numbers in a given array, without
using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_second_lowest_highest(arr):
n = len(arr)
if n < 2:
return None
# Initialize the second lowest and highest numbers to the first and last
element of the array
second_lowest = second_highest = arr[0]
# Find the lowest and highest numbers in the array
lowest = highest = arr[0]
for i in range(1, n):
if arr[i] < lowest:
second_lowest = lowest
lowest = arr[i]
elif arr[i] < second_lowest or second_lowest == lowest:
second_lowest = arr[i]
if arr[i] > highest:
second_highest = highest
highest = arr[i]
elif arr[i] > second_highest or second_highest == highest:
second_highest = arr[i]
return (second_lowest, second_highest)
# Example usage
arr = [5, 8, 2, 10, 3, 6, 7, 9]
second_lowest, second_highest = find_second_lowest_highest(arr)
print("Second lowest number:", second_lowest)
print("Second highest number:", second_highest)
# Output: Second lowest number: 3, Second highest number: 9
In this program, we initialize the second lowest and highest numbers to the first element of the
array. We then loop through the array and update the lowest, second lowest, highest, and second
highest numbers accordingly.
We first find the lowest and highest numbers in the array. We then update the second lowest and
highest numbers if the current element is smaller or larger than the current second lowest orhighest number, respectively. We also check if the current element is equal to the current lowest or
highest number, and if so, we don't update the second lowest or highest number.
The function returns a tuple containing the second lowest and highest numbers, respectively.
Note that this program assumes that the input array contains at least two distinct elements. If the
array contains less than two elements, the function returns None.
2. Write a program in Python to print the sum of two numbers. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
Here's a Python program to print the sum of two numbers without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
a = 5
b = 7
sum = a
carry = b
while carry != 0:
# perform bitwise exclusive OR to add the carry bit to the sum without
carry
sum = a ^ carry
# perform bitwise AND to calculate the carry bit
carry = (a & carry) << 1
# update the values of a and b for the next iteration
a = sum
b = carry
print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is", sum)
In this program, we perform bitwise operations to add two numbers without using the + operator.
We first initialize the variables sum and carry to the values of the two numbers a and b,
respectively.
We then enter a loop that continues until the carry bit becomes 0. In each iteration of the loop, we
perform the following steps:
1. Calculate the sum of a and carry without the carry bit using bitwise exclusive OR
operator (^).
2. Calculate the carry bit using bitwise AND operator (&) and left shift operator (<<).
3. Update the values of a and carry for the next iteration.
Finally, we print the sum of the two numbers.
Note that this program assumes that the input numbers are non-negative integers.5. Write a in Python program to check the upper and lower limits of integers. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to check the upper and lower limits of integers without using any inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Check upper limit
i = 1
while i + 1 > i:
i += 1
print("The upper limit of integers is", i)
# Check lower limit
i = -1
while i - 1 < i:
i -= 1
print("The lower limit of integers is", i)
In this program, we use a while loop to check the upper and lower limits of integers. We initialize
the variable i to 1 for checking the upper limit, and -1 for checking the lower limit.
For checking the upper limit, we keep incrementing i by 1 until i+1 becomes less than or equal
to i. This happens when i reaches its upper limit, and the loop terminates. We then print the value
of i.
For checking the lower limit, we keep decrementing i by 1 until i-1 becomes greater than or
equal to i. This happens when i reaches its lower limit, and the loop terminates. We then print the
value of i.
Note that this program assumes that the system on which the program is run has a finite upper and
lower limit for integers.
6. Write a Python program that checks whether primitive values cross the limit. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Primitive values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans have specific limits or
ranges. Here's a Python program that checks whether these primitive values cross their respective
limits or not, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Check integer limit
i = 2147483647 # Maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer
i += 1if i < 0:
print("Integer limit crossed")
else:
print("Integer limit not crossed")
# Check floating-point limit
f = 1.7976931348623157e+308 # Maximum value of a float
f *= 2
if f == float('inf'):
print("Floating-point limit crossed")
else:
print("Floating-point limit not crossed")
# Check boolean limit
b = True
b = not b
if b:
print("Boolean limit crossed")
else:
print("Boolean limit not crossed")
In this program, we first check the limit of integers by initializing the variable i to the maximum
value of a 32-bit signed integer (2147483647), and then incrementing it by 1. If the value of i
becomes negative, then the limit is crossed, and we print a message accordingly.
Next, we check the limit of floating-point numbers by initializing the variable f to the maximum
value of a float (1.7976931348623157e+308), and then multiplying it by 2. If the value of f
becomes infinity, then the limit is crossed, and we print a message accordingly.
Finally, we check the limit of booleans by initializing the variable b to True, and then negating it
using the not operator. If the value of b becomes True again, then the limit is crossed, and we
print a message accordingly.
Note that the specific limits or ranges of primitive values may vary depending on the system or
programming language used.
8. Write a Python program to check overflow/underflow during various arithmetic operations.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Overflow and underflow can occur during arithmetic operations when the result of the operation
exceeds the maximum or minimum representable value of the data type. Here's a Python program
that checks for overflow and underflow during various arithmetic operations, without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code# Check integer overflow and underflow
a = 2147483647 # Maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer
b = 1
if a + b < 0:
print("Integer overflow")
else:
print("Integer not overflow")
a = -2147483648 # Minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer
b = -1
if a + b > 0:
print("Integer underflow")
else:
print("Integer not underflow")
# Check floating-point overflow and underflow
a = 1.7976931348623157e+308 # Maximum value of a float
b = a * 2
if b == float('inf'):
print("Floating-point overflow")
else:
print("Floating-point not overflow")
a = 2.2250738585072014e-308 # Minimum value of a normalized float
b = a / 2
if b == 0.0:
print("Floating-point underflow")
else:
print("Floating-point not underflow")
In this program, we first check for integer overflow by initializing a to the maximum value of a
32-bit signed integer (2147483647), and b to 1. If the result of a + b is negative, then overflow
has occurred, and we print a message accordingly. Similarly, we check for integer underflow by
initializing a to the minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer (-2147483648), and b to -1. If the
result of a + b is positive, then underflow has occurred, and we print a message accordingly.
Next, we check for floating-point overflow by initializing a to the maximum value of a float
(1.7976931348623157e+308), and b to a * 2. If the value of b becomes infinity, then overflow
has occurred, and we print a message accordingly. Similarly, we check for floating-point
underflow by initializing a to the minimum value of a normalized float (2.2250738585072014e-
308), and b to a / 2. If the value of b becomes 0.0, then underflow has occurred, and we print a
message accordingly.
Note that the specific limits or ranges of primitive values may vary depending on the system or
programming language used. Also, some languages may have inbuilt functions or methods to
detect overflow and underflow.10. Write a Python program to format the output. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that formats the output without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
result = num1 + num2
print("The sum of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))
In this program, we use string formatting to print the sum of num1 and num2 in a specific format.
The format() method is used to substitute the values of num1, num2, and result into the
string.
We can also use the old-style string formatting using the % operator, like this:
pythonCopy code
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
result = num1 + num2
print("The sum of %d and %d is %d" % (num1, num2, result))
This will produce the same output as the previous program.
12. Write a Python program to add two numbers and accept them from the keyboard. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that accepts two numbers from the keyboard and adds them
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(num1):
sum += 1
for i in range(num2):
sum += 1print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
In this program, we use a for loop to add the two numbers. We first initialize the variable sum to
zero, and then use two separate loops to increment it by one num1 and num2 times, respectively.
Finally, we print the result using a formatted string.
Note that we use the input() function to read the user's input as a string, and then convert it to
an integer using the int() function.
13. Write a Python program that swaps two numbers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that swaps two numbers without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
print("Before swapping: num1 =", num1, ", num2 =", num2)
# Swapping the values of num1 and num2 using a temporary variable
temp = num1
num1 = num2
num2 = temp
print("After swapping: num1 =", num1, ", num2 =", num2)
In this program, we first read two numbers from the user using the input() function and convert
them to integers using the int() function. Then, we print the values of the two numbers before
swapping them.
To swap the values of the two numbers, we use a temporary variable temp. We assign the value of
num1 to temp, and then assign the value of num2 to num1. Finally, we assign the value of temp
to num2.
Finally, we print the values of the two numbers after swapping them.
14. Write a Python program that calculates the volume of a sphere. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's an example Python program that calculates the volume of a sphere without using any inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy coderadius = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))
pi = 3.14159
# Calculating the volume of the sphere using the formula (4/3) * pi * r^3
volume = (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3)
print("The volume of the sphere is:", volume)
In this program, we first read the radius of the sphere from the user using the input() function
and convert it to a float using the float() function. We also define the value of pi as 3.14159.
To calculate the volume of the sphere, we use the formula (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3), where **
represents exponentiation. We then assign the calculated volume to the variable volume.
Finally, we print the calculated volume of the sphere using the print() function.
2. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the first 10 natural numbers. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that finds the sum of the first 10 natural numbers without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Initializing the variables
n = 10
sum = 0
# Looping through the first 10 natural numbers and adding them to the sum
for i in range(1, n+1):
sum += i
# Printing the sum of the first 10 natural numbers
print("The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:", sum)
In this program, we first initialize two variables n and sum, where n represents the maximum
natural number we want to sum and sum represents the sum of the natural numbers.
We then loop through the first n natural numbers using the range() function with the arguments
(1, n+1). For each number i in the range, we add it to the variable sum using the += operator.
Finally, we print the calculated sum of the first 10 natural numbers using the print() function.
4. Write a program in Python to find the perfect numbers between 1 and 500. without using an
inbuilt function or method.A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding
itself). For example, 6 is a perfect number as its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
To find all the perfect numbers between 1 and 500, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to
500, and for each number, we can check if it is a perfect number or not. Here's the Python program
to do that:
pythonCopy code
# iterate through all numbers from 1 to 500
for num in range(1, 501):
# find all proper divisors of the number
divisors = []
for i in range(1, num):
if num % i == 0:
divisors.append(i)
# check if the number is a perfect number
if sum(divisors) == num:
print(num)
This program uses two nested loops to iterate through all numbers from 1 to 500, and for each
number, it finds all its proper divisors using another loop. It then checks if the sum of the divisors
is equal to the number itself, and if it is, it prints the number. Note that this program does not use
any inbuilt functions or methods to find the proper divisors or the sum of the divisors.
5. Write a program in Python to check whether a number is prime or not. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Sure, here's a Python program to check whether a given number is prime or not without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
is_prime = True
if num < 2:
is_prime = False
else:
for i in range(2, num):
if num % i == 0:
is_prime = False
break
if is_prime:
print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
print(num, "is not a prime number")In this program, we first take an integer input from the user and set a boolean variable is_prime
to True. If the input number is less than 2, then it cannot be prime and we set is_prime to
False. Otherwise, we loop through all the numbers from 2 to the input number minus 1 and
check if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is, then we know that the input number
is not prime and we set is_prime to False and break out of the loop.
Finally, we check the value of is_prime and print a message accordingly.
8. Write a program in Python to find the last prime number that occurs before the entered number.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
To find the last prime number before the entered number, we can start checking for prime numbers
from the entered number and decrement it by 1 until we find a prime number. Here is the Python
program to do the same without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
if num <= 1:
return False
for i in range(2, int(num**(1/2))+1):
if num % i == 0:
return False
return True
# take user input for the limit
limit = int(input("Enter the limit: "))
# start checking for prime numbers from the entered number and decrement it by
1 until we find a prime number
while limit > 1:
if is_prime(limit):
print("The last prime number before", limit, "is", limit)
break
limit -= 1
else:
print("There is no prime number before", limit)
In this program, the is_prime() function is used to check whether a number is prime or not.
The while loop starts checking for prime numbers from the entered number and decrements it by
1 until it finds a prime number. If a prime number is found, the program prints the result,
otherwise, it prints a message that there is no prime number before the entered number.10. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the digits of a given number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the sum of digits of a given number without using inbuilt
functions:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0
while num > 0:
digit = num % 10
sum += digit
num //= 10
print("The sum of digits is:", sum)
In this program, we first take an input from the user and initialize a variable sum to 0. Then, we
use a while loop to iterate through the digits of the input number.
Inside the loop, we use the modulus operator % to get the rightmost digit of the number, add it to
sum, and update the number by dividing it by 10 and discarding the remainder (using integer
division //).
Once the loop finishes, we print the final sum of digits.
12. Write a program in Python to calculate the sum of the series (1*1) + (2*2) + (3*3) + (4*4) +
(5*5) + ... + (n*n). without using an inbuilt function or method.
We can use a loop to iterate from 1 to n and calculate the sum of the series using the formula
(n*(n+1)(2n+1))/6.
Here's the Python code to calculate the sum of the series:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
sum += i*i
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)
In this code, we first take the input value of n from the user. We initialize the sum variable to 0. We
then use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n, and for each iteration, we add the square of i to the sum
variable. Finally, we print the sum of the series.13. Write a program in Python to calculate the series (1) + (1+2) + (1+2+3) + (1+2+3+4) + ... +
(1+2+3+4+...+n). without using an inbuilt function or method.
We can use a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n and add up the sum of each series.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
for j in range(1, i+1):
sum += j
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)
In this program, we first take an input from the user to get the value of n. Then, we initialize a
variable sum to 0 to store the sum of the series.
We use a nested loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n. The outer loop runs from 1 to n,
and the inner loop runs from 1 to the current value of the outer loop variable.
In each iteration of the inner loop, we add the value of j to the sum variable. Finally, we print out
the sum of the series.
15. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter positive integers in order to process count,
maximum, minimum, and average or terminate the process with -1. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a program in Python that asks the user to enter positive integers and then calculates the
count, maximum, minimum, and average. The program terminates when the user enters -1. This
program does not use any inbuilt function or method.
pythonCopy code
count = 0
total = 0
maximum = -float("inf")
minimum = float("inf")
while True:
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer (-1 to terminate): "))
if num == -1:
break
if num < 1:
print("Invalid input! Please enter a positive integer.")
continue
count += 1total += num
if num > maximum:
maximum = num
if num < minimum:
minimum = num
if count == 0:
print("No numbers were entered.")
else:
average = total / count
print("Count: ", count)
print("Maximum: ", maximum)
print("Minimum: ", minimum)
print("Average: ", average)
The program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they enter -1 to
terminate the process. Inside the loop, the program checks if the input is a positive integer and
adds it to the total and updates the maximum and minimum values if necessary. The program also
keeps track of the count of the numbers entered. Once the loop is terminated, the program
calculates the average and prints the count, maximum, minimum, and average. If the count is 0
(i.e., no numbers were entered), the program prints a message indicating that no numbers were
entered.
17. Write a program in Python to print a square pattern with the # character. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a solution to print a square pattern with the # character without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
# loop through rows
for i in range(n):
# loop through columns
for j in range(n):
# print '#' for the first and last rows and columns
if i == 0 or i == n-1 or j == 0 or j == n-1:
print("#", end="")
else:
print(" ", end="")
print() # move to the next line
In this program, we first take input from the user to determine the number of rows to be printed.
Then we use nested loops to iterate through each row and column of the square pattern. We checkwhether the current element is on the first or last row or column, and if so, we print the #
character. Otherwise, we print a space character. Finally, we move to the next line by using the
print() function with no arguments.
20. Write a Python program that displays the sum of n odd natural numbers. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that displays the sum of n odd natural numbers without using any inbuilt
functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
sum += i
print("The sum of first", n, "odd natural numbers is:", sum)
In this program, we first take input from the user for the value of n. Then, we initialize a variable
sum to zero.
Next, we use a for loop that iterates from 1 to 2*n (exclusive), with a step size of 2. This means
that the loop iterates over all odd numbers from 1 to 2n-1.
Inside the loop, we add the current number i to the variable sum. Finally, we print out the sum of
the first n odd natural numbers.
22. Write a program in Python to display the n terms of a harmonic series and their sum. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python that displays the n terms of a harmonic series and their sum, without
using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
# initialize variables
sum = 0
term = 1
# loop to calculate sum and print terms
for i in range(1, n+1):
print(term, end=" ")
sum += term
term = 1 / (i+1)# print the sum of the series
print("\nThe sum of the harmonic series is:", sum)
In this program, the user is asked to enter the number of terms they want to display in the
harmonic series. Then, the program initializes two variables, sum and term, and starts a loop to
calculate the terms of the series and the sum.
Inside the loop, the current term is printed using print(term, end=" "), and then added to
the running total sum. The term variable is then updated to be the reciprocal of the next integer
in the series.
After the loop completes, the program prints the sum of the series using print("\nThe sum
of the harmonic series is:", sum).
24. Write a program in Python to display the sum of the series [ 1+x+x^2/2!+x^3/3!+....]. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
To display the sum of the series [ 1+x+x^2/2!+x^3/3!+....], we need to first calculate the factorial
of each number in the series. We can do this using loops and basic mathematical operations. Here's
a Python program that displays the sum of the series without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Program to display the sum of the series [ 1+x+x^2/2!+x^3/3!+....]
# Taking input values for x and n
x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
# Initializing sum and factorial to 1
sum = 1
factorial = 1
# Loop to calculate the sum of the series
for i in range(1, n):
factorial = factorial * i
term = x ** i / factorial
sum = sum + term
# Displaying the sum of the series
print("Sum of the series is: ", sum)
In this program, we first take the input values for x and n. Then we initialize the sum and factorial
variables to 1. We use a loop to calculate the factorial of each number in the series and the
corresponding term. We add the term to the sum to get the final result. Finally, we display the sum
of the series.26. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the series 1 +11 + 111 + 1111 + .. n terms. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
To find the sum of the series 1 + 11 + 111 + 1111 + ... n terms without using an inbuilt function or
method, we can use a loop to generate each term of the series and add them together. Here's the
Python code to do that:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
sum = 0
term = 1
for i in range(n):
sum += term
term = term * 10 + 1
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)
In this code, we first ask the user to enter the number of terms they want to sum up. Then we
initialize the sum to zero and the first term of the series to 1. We use a for loop to iterate through
the range of numbers from 0 to n-1, generating each term of the series by multiplying the previous
term by 10 and adding 1 to it. We add each term to the sum as we go. Finally, we print out the sum
of the series.
28. Write a program in Python to find the number and sum of all integers between 100 and 200
which are divisible by 9. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python that finds the number and sum of all integers between 100 and 200
which are divisible by 9:
pythonCopy code
count = 0
total = 0
for i in range(100, 201):
if i % 9 == 0:
count += 1
total += i
print("Number of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9:", count)
print("Sum of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9:", total)
Output:
yamlCopy codeNumber of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9: 12
Sum of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9: 1503
30. Write a program in Python to display the numbers in reverse order. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a Python program to display the numbers in reverse order without using an inbuilt function
or method:
phpCopy code
# get the input number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# loop through the digits of the number in reverse order
while num > 0:
digit = num % 10
print(digit, end='')
num //= 10
In this program, we first get the input number from the user using the input() function and
convert it to an integer using the int() function.
We then loop through the digits of the number in reverse order by repeatedly taking the modulo 10
of the number to get the rightmost digit and printing it using the print() function with the end
argument set to an empty string to prevent a newline from being printed. We then divide the
number by 10 using integer division (//) to remove the rightmost digit and continue the loop until
the number becomes 0.
Finally, the output will be the numbers in reverse order.
31. Write a Python program to find the sum of an A.P. series. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
An arithmetic progression (A.P.) is a sequence of numbers in which each term is obtained by
adding a fixed number to the preceding term, except for the first term which is given. The formula
to calculate the sum of n terms of an A.P. is given by:
Sum = n/2 * (2 * a + (n - 1) * d)
where n is the number of terms, a is the first term and d is the common difference.
Here's the Python program to find the sum of an A.P. series without using any inbuilt function or
method:pythonCopy code
# program to find the sum of an A.P. series
#
n
a
d
take input from the user
= int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
= int(input("Enter the first term: "))
= int(input("Enter the common difference: "))
# initialize the sum variable to 0
sum = 0
# calculate the sum of the A.P. series
for i in range(n):
term = a + i * d
sum += term
# print the sum of the A.P. series
print("Sum of the A.P. series:", sum)
In this program, we take input from the user for the number of terms, first term and common
difference of the A.P. series. We then initialize the sum variable to 0 and use a for loop to calculate
the sum of the A.P. series by adding each term to the sum variable. Finally, we print the sum of the
A.P. series.
32. Write a Python program to find the sum of the GP series. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
To find the sum of a GP (geometric progression) series, we can use the formula:
scssCopy code
S = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r)
where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, n is the number of terms and S is the sum of the
series.
Here is the Python program to find the sum of a GP series without using an inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
a = float(input("Enter the first term: "))
r = float(input("Enter the common ratio: "))
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
S = a * (1 - r**n) / (1 - r)
print("The sum of the GP series is", S)In this program, we first ask the user to enter the first term, common ratio and number of terms.
Then we use the formula to calculate the sum of the series and print the result.
34. Write a program in Python to find the length of a string without using the library function.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python to find the length of a string without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
# get the string input from user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# initialize a counter variable
count = 0
# iterate over each character in the string
for char in string:
count += 1
# print the length of the string
print("Length of the string is:", count)
In this program, we first take the input string from the user using the input() function. Then,
we initialize a counter variable to 0. Next, we use a for loop to iterate over each character in the
string and increment the counter variable for each character. Finally, we print the count which
gives us the length of the string.
35. Write a program in Python to display a pattern like a right angle triangle using an asterisk.

Here's the solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
# take input from user
n = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
# loop through rows
for i in range(1, n+1):
# loop through columns
for j in range(1, i+1):

Here's a Python program that displays the pattern like a right angle triangle with the number
increased by 1:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
num = 1for i in range(1, rows+1):
for j in range(1, i+1):

39. Write a Python program to make such a pattern like a pyramid with numbers increased by 1.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10
Here's a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
# calculate the maximum number of digits needed
max_digits = len(str(rows*(rows+1)//2))
# iterate over rows and columns to print the pyramid
for i in range(rows):
for j in range(rows-i-1):
print(" "*(max_digits+1), end="")
for j in range(i+1):
num = i*(i+1)//2 + j + 1
print(str(num).rjust(max_digits), end=" ")
print()
Explanation:
• The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows for the pyramid.
• The program calculates the maximum number of digits needed to print the numbers. This is
done by computing the maximum number in the pyramid (which is the sum of the first n
natural numbers, where n is the number of rows), and then finding the length of that
number as a string.
• The program then iterates over each row and column, and prints spaces to align the
numbers properly. It then computes the value of each number in the pyramid using theformula for triangular numbers, and prints it with the appropriate amount of padding using
the rjust() method.
Example output for rows = 4:

40. Write a Python program to make such a pattern like a pyramid with an asterisk. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Here's the code to display a pyramid pattern with asterisks without using any built-in function:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
for i in range(1, rows+1):
for j in range(1, rows-i+1):
print(" ", end="")
for j in range(1, i*2):
print("*", end="")
print()
Explanation:
• The user is asked to input the number of rows for the pyramid pattern.
• The outer loop iterates through the range of 1 to the given number of rows.
• The first inner loop prints the spaces before the asterisks in each row by iterating through
the range of 1 to the difference between the given number of rows and the current row
number.
• The second inner loop prints the asterisks in each row by iterating through the range of 1 to
the current row number multiplied by 2 (since the number of asterisks in each row is an
odd number).
• The print() statement after the second inner loop is to move the cursor to the next line for
the next row.42. Write a Python program that displays the pattern like a pyramid using asterisks, with odd
numbers in each row. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of
rows: 5 * *** ***** *******
Here's the Python code to display the pattern like a pyramid using asterisks, with odd numbers in
each row:
pythonCopy code

# The maximum number of asterisks in the base of the pyramid
max_asterisks = rows * 2 - 1
# Loop through each row
for i in range(rows):
# The number of asterisks in this row
num_asterisks = i * 2 + 1
# The number of spaces before the asterisks in this row
num_spaces = (max_asterisks - num_asterisks) // 2
# Print the spaces
print(" " * num_spaces, end="")
# Print the asterisks
for j in range(num_asterisks):

num_rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))num = 1
for i in range(1, num_rows + 1):
for j in range(1, i + 1):
if num % 2 == 0:

45. Write a Python program to display Pascal's triangle like a pyramid. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1
Here's a Python program to display Pascal's triangle:
pythonCopy code
num_rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
for i in range(num_rows):
row = []
for j in range(i+1):
if j == 0 or j == i:
row.append(1)
else:
row.append(triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j])
triangle.append(row)
max_val = len(str(triangle[num_rows-1][num_rows//2]))
for i in range(num_rows):
print(" "*(max_val*(num_rows-i)), end="")
for j in range(i+1):
val = str(triangle[i][j])
print(val.center(max_val, " "), end=" ")
print()
Here's how it works:1. Prompt the user to input the number of rows in the triangle.
2. Use a nested loop to create a list of lists triangle containing the numbers in Pascal's
triangle. For each row i and column j in that row, set the value to 1 if j is the first or last
column, and to the sum of the values above and to the left of it otherwise.
3. Determine the maximum width of a number in the triangle to ensure that all numbers are
evenly spaced.
4. Use another nested loop to print the triangle. For each row i, print num_rows-i spaces
before the first number in that row, then print each number in the row centered within a

321
4321
54321In this program, we first take the number of rows as input from the user. Then we use a for loop
to iterate through the rows, starting from 1 and going up to the given number of rows.
For each row, we use the str.join() method to join the digits in descending order (from the
row number to 1) into a string, separated by spaces. We then use the str.format() method to
right justify the resulting string within a field width of 5, using the {:>5} format specifier.
Finally, we print the resulting string for each row using the print() function.
55. Write a program in Python to display such a pattern for n number of rows using numbers. There
will be odd numbers in each row. The first and last number of each row will be 1 and the middle
column will be the row number. N numbers of columns will appear in the 1st row. without using an

123454321 1234321 12321 121 1
Here's the Python program to display the pattern as described:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
# The number of columns in the first row
cols = 2 * rows - 1
for i in range(rows):
# The number of spaces before the row
spaces = i * 2

57. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the first and last digits of a number. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input any number: 12345 The first digit of 12345 is:
1 The last digit of 12345 is: 5 The sum of first and last digit of 12345 is: 6
Here's the Python code to find the sum of the first and last digits of a number without using any
inbuilt function or method:
phpCopy code
num = int(input("Input any number: "))
first_digit = 0
last_digit = num % 10
while num > 0:
if num < 10:
first_digit = num
num //= 10
sum_first_last = first_digit + last_digit
print("The first digit of", num, "is:", first_digit)
print("The last digit of", num, "is:", last_digit)
print("The sum of first and last digit of", num, "is:", sum_first_last)
In this code, we take the input number from the user and initialize the first_digit variable to
zero and last_digit variable to the remainder of the number when divided by 10 (which gives
the last digit of the number). Then we loop through the number and keep dividing it by 10 until we
reach the first digit (when the number becomes less than 10). We add the first and last digits and
print the output.
59. Write a program in Python to find the frequency of each digit in a given integer. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input any number: 122345 The frequency of 0 = 0
The frequency of 1 = 1 The frequency of 2 = 2 The frequency of 3 = 1 The frequency of 4 = 1 The
frequency of 5 = 1 The frequency of 6 = 0 The frequency of 7 = 0 The frequency of 8 = 0 The
frequency of 9 = 0To find the frequency of each digit in a given integer, we can convert the integer into a string,
iterate over the string and count the frequency of each digit using a dictionary. Here's the Python
code to achieve this without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Input any number: "))
num_str = str(num)
freq_dict = {}
# Count frequency of each digit
for i in range(10):
freq_dict[str(i)] = 0
for digit in num_str:
freq_dict[digit] += 1
# Display frequency of each digit
for i in range(10):
print("The frequency of " + str(i) + " = " + str(freq_dict[str(i)]))
Output:
arduinoCopy code
Input any number: 122345
The frequency of 0 = 0
The frequency of 1 = 1
The frequency of 2 = 2
The frequency of 3 = 1
The frequency of 4 = 1
The frequency of 5 = 1
The frequency of 6 = 0
The frequency of 7 = 0
The frequency of 8 = 0
The frequency of 9 = 0

D 69 --> E 70 --> F 71 --> G 72 --> H 73 --> I 74 --> J 75 --> K
Here's the code to achieve the desired output:
pythonCopy code
# ASCII range for printable characters is from 32 to 126
# 32 - Space, 126 - ~
# chr() function returns a character for a given ASCII code
start = int(input("Input the starting value for ASCII characters: "))end = int(input("Input the ending value for ASCII characters: "))
print("The ASCII characters:")
for i in range(start, end+1):
print(f"{i} --> {chr(i)}")
Sample Output:
rustCopy code
Input the starting value for ASCII characters: 65
Input the ending value for ASCII characters: 75
The ASCII characters:
65 --> A
66 --> B
67 --> C
68 --> D

63. Write a program in Python to enter any number and print all factors of the number. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a number: 63 The factors are: 1 3 7 9 21
63
Here's a Python program to print all factors of a number entered by the user without using any
inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Input a number: "))
print("The factors are:", end=" ")
for i in range(1, num+1):
if num % i == 0:
print(i, end=" ")
Explanation:
1. Get an integer input from the user using the input() function and convert it to an integer
using the int() function. Assign it to the variable num.
2. Initialize a loop using the range() function from 1 to num+1. This will iterate through all
the possible factors of the number.3. Check if the number is divisible by the current value of the loop variable using the modulo
% operator. If the result is 0, then the current value of the loop variable is a factor of the
number.
4. If the current value of the loop variable is a factor of the number, print it using the
print() function with the end argument set to a space to separate the factors on a single
line.
65. Write a program in Python to find the two's complement of a binary number. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a 8 bit binary value: 01101110 The original
binary = 01101110 After ones complement the value = 10010001 After twos complement the value
= 10010010
Here's the Python code to find the two's complement of a binary number:
pythonCopy code
# Input a binary number
binary_num = input("Enter an 8 bit binary number: ")
# Find the ones complement of the binary number
ones_complement = ""
for bit in binary_num:
ones_complement += "0" if bit == "1" else "1"
# Find the twos complement of the binary number
twos_complement = ""
carry = 1
for bit in ones_complement[::-1]:
if bit == "1" and carry == 1:
twos_complement = "0" + twos_complement
elif bit == "0" and carry == 1:
twos_complement = "1" + twos_complement
carry = 0
else:
twos_complement = bit + twos_complement
# Print the original binary number, ones complement, and twos complement
print("The original binary = " + binary_num)
print("After ones complement the value = " + ones_complement)
print("After twos complement the value = " + twos_complement)
Note that this code assumes that the input binary number is 8 bits long. If you want to handle
binary numbers of different lengths, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.67. Write a program in Python to calculate the sum of the series 1.2+2.3+3.4+4.5+5.6+....... without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input the last integer between 1 to 98 without
fraction you want to add: 10 1.2 + 2.3 + 3.4 + 4.5 + 5.6 + 6.7 + 7.8 + 8.9 + 9.1 + 10.11 The sum of
the series =59.61
69. Write a program in Python to produce a square matrix with 0's down the main diagonal, 1's in
the entries just above and below the main diagonal, 2's above and below that, etc. without using an
inbuilt function or method. 0 1 2 3 4 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 4 3 2 1 0 Sample Output: Input

71. Write a program in Python to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a decimal number: 43 The hexadecimal
number is : 2B
Here's the Python program to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
decimal = int(input("Input a decimal number: "))
hexadecimal = ""
hex_digits = "0123456789ABCDEF"
while decimal > 0:
remainder = decimal % 16
hexadecimal = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal
decimal = decimal // 16
print("The hexadecimal number is: ", hexadecimal)
In this program, we first take an integer decimal as input from the user. Then, we define an empty
string hexadecimal to store the hexadecimal number. We also define the string hex_digits
containing all hexadecimal digits from 0 to F.
We use a while loop to convert the decimal number to hexadecimal. Inside the loop, we compute
the remainder when decimal is divided by 16 and append the corresponding hexadecimal digit
to hexadecimal. We then update decimal by floor dividing it with 16.
Finally, we print the result.73. Write a Python program to convert a binary number to a decimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a binary number: 1011 The decimal number: 11
Here's the solution to your problem:
sqlCopy code
binary = input("Input a binary number: ")
decimal = 0
power = len(binary) - 1
for digit in binary:
decimal += int(digit) * (2 ** power)
power -= 1
print("The decimal number:", decimal)
In this program, we first take input of the binary number as a string. Then we initialize a variable
decimal to 0 and another variable power to the length of the binary string minus 1. We loop
through each digit in the binary string and convert it to an integer. We then multiply this integer by
2 raised to the power of power and add it to the decimal variable. Finally, we decrement
power by 1 to move on to the next digit. Once the loop is done, we print out the resulting decimal
number.
74. Write a Python program to convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
binary = input("Enter a binary number: ")
# pad the binary number with leading zeros so that its length is a multiple of
4
while len(binary) % 4 != 0:
binary = '0' + binary
# dictionary to map binary nibbles to hexadecimal
hex_map = {'0000': '0', '0001': '1', '0010': '2',
'0100': '4', '0101': '5', '0110': '6',
'1000': '8', '1001': '9', '1010': 'A',
'1100': 'C', '1101': 'D', '1110': 'E',
digits
'0011':
'0111':
'1011':
'1111':
'3',
'7',
'B',
'F'}
# split the binary number into nibbles of 4 bits each
nibbles = [binary[i:i+4] for i in range(0, len(binary), 4)]# convert each nibble to its hexadecimal equivalent using the hex_map
dictionary
hexadecimal = ''.join([hex_map[nibble] for nibble in nibbles])
print(f"The hexadecimal equivalent of {binary} is {hexadecimal}")
In this program, we first take the binary number as input from the user. We then pad the binary
number with leading zeros so that its length is a multiple of 4, as hexadecimal numbers are
represented using nibbles (groups of 4 bits). We then define a dictionary hex_map that maps each
binary nibble to its corresponding hexadecimal digit. We split the binary number into nibbles of 4
bits each, and then convert each nibble to its hexadecimal equivalent using the hex_map
dictionary. Finally, we join the hexadecimal digits to form the hexadecimal equivalent of the
binary number, and print it out.
Here's an example output of the program:
vbnetCopy code
Enter a binary number: 110110101011
The hexadecimal equivalent of 110110101011 is 6DAB
76. Write a Python program to convert an octal number to a decimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to convert an octal number to a decimal number without using any built-
in function or method:
pythonCopy code
octal = input("Enter an octal number: ")
decimal = 0
power = 0
for digit in octal[::-1]:
decimal += int(digit) * (8 ** power)
power += 1
print("The decimal equivalent of", octal, "is", decimal)
In this program, we first take the octal number as input from the user using the input()
function. We then initialize the decimal variable to 0 and the power variable to 0.
We then iterate over each digit of the octal number in reverse order using the slice notation [::-
1]. For each digit, we convert it to an integer using the int() function and multiply it by 8
raised to the power of power. We add this value to the decimal variable and then increment
power by 1.Finally, we print out the decimal equivalent of the octal number using the print() function.
78. Write a Python program to convert an octal number to a hexadecimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to convert an octal number to a hexadecimal number without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
octal = input("Enter an octal number: ")
decimal = 0
# Convert octal to decimal
for i in range(len(octal)):
digit = int(octal[i])
power = len(octal) - i - 1
decimal += digit * 8**power
hexadecimal = ""
# Convert decimal to hexadecimal
while decimal != 0:
remainder = decimal % 16
if remainder < 10:
hexadecimal = str(remainder) + hexadecimal
else:
hexadecimal = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('A')) + hexadecimal
decimal //= 16
print("The hexadecimal equivalent of", octal, "is", hexadecimal)
In this program, the user is prompted to enter an octal number. The program first converts the octal
number to a decimal number by multiplying each digit of the octal number with the corresponding
power of 8 and adding the results. Then, the program converts the decimal number to a
hexadecimal number by repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 16 and converting the
remainders to hexadecimal digits. The resulting hexadecimal digits are combined to form the final
hexadecimal number, which is printed to the console.
82. Write a program in Python to compare two numbers. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
Here's a Python program to compare two numbers without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
if num1 == num2:
print("Both numbers are equal")
elif num1 > num2:
print(num1, "is greater than", num2)
else:
print(num2, "is greater than", num1)
This program takes two numbers as input from the user, and then compares them using conditional
statements. If the two numbers are equal, it prints a message saying so. Otherwise, it prints a
message indicating which number is greater. Note that this program does not use any built-in
comparison functions or methods.
84. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the digits of an integer using a function. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that computes the sum of the digits of an integer using a function:
pythonCopy code
def sum_of_digits(num):
"""
This function computes the sum of the digits of an integer.
"""
sum = 0
while num > 0:
digit = num % 10
sum += digit
num //= 10
return sum
# Example usage:
num = 12345
print("The sum of the digits of", num, "is", sum_of_digits(num))
Output:
pythonCopy code
The sum of the digits of 12345 is 15
Explanation: The function sum_of_digits takes an integer num as input and initializes a
variable sum to 0. Then it enters a loop that iterates as long as num is greater than 0. In each
iteration, the last digit of num is extracted by computing the remainder of num divided by 10
(using the modulus operator %), and this digit is added to sum. Then the last digit is removed from
num by integer division (num //= 10). After the loop completes, the function returns the final
value of sum.86. Write a Python program to count the letters, spaces, numbers and other characters in an input
string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that counts the number of letters, spaces, numbers, and other characters
in an input string without using any built-in functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
input_str = input("Enter a string: ")
letter_count = 0
space_count = 0
number_count = 0
other_count = 0
for char in input_str:
if (char >= 'a' and char <= 'z') or (char >= 'A' and char <= 'Z'):
letter_count += 1
elif char == ' ':
space_count += 1
elif char >= '0' and char <= '9':
number_count += 1
else:
other_count += 1
print("Number
print("Number
print("Number
print("Number
of
of
of
of
letters:", letter_count)
spaces:", space_count)
numbers:", number_count)
other characters:", other_count)
In this program, we use a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string. We then check
if the character is a letter, space, number, or other character, and increment the corresponding
count variable.
Note that we use ASCII values to check if a character is a letter or number. Characters 'a' to 'z' and
'A' to 'Z' have ASCII values between 97 and 122 and between 65 and 90, respectively. Characters
'0' to '9' have ASCII values between 48 and 57. Any character that doesn't fall into these ranges is
considered an other character.
2. Write a Python program to find the absolute difference between n and 51. If n is greater than 51

In this solution, we define a function check_integers_range that takes two integers a and
b as input. The function checks whether both integers are in the range 40..50 inclusive, or both are
in the range 50..60 inclusive, and returns 1 if they are, and 0 otherwise. We use logical operators
(and and or) to check the conditions.
We test the function using the sample test cases and print the expected output.
22. Write a Python program to check if a given string contains between 2 and 4 'z' characters.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "frizz" "zane" "Zazz" "false" Sample
Output: 1 0 1 0Here's one way to solve this:
pythonCopy code
def contains_z(string):
count = 0
for letter in string:
if letter == 'z' or letter == 'Z':
count += 1
return count >= 2 and count <= 4
print(contains_z("frizz"))
print(contains_z("zane"))
print(contains_z("Zazz"))
print(contains_z("false"))
Output:
Copy code
1
0
1
0
Explanation: The contains_z function takes a string as input and initializes a variable count
to 0. It then iterates through each character in the string, checking if it is a 'z' or 'Z' character. If it
is, it increments the count variable. Finally, the function returns True if the count variable is
between 2 and 4 (inclusive), and False otherwise.
We then call the function with the given sample inputs to check if it works correctly.
23. Write a Python program to check if two given non-negative integers have the same last digit.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 123, 456 12, 512 7, 87 12, 45 Sample
Output: 0 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first non-negative integer: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second non-negative integer: "))
if num1 % 10 == num2 % 10:
print("The two integers have the same last digit.")
else:
print("The two integers do not have the same last digit.")We take two non-negative integers as input and check if they have the same last digit. To do this,
we use the modulo operator % to get the remainder when each number is divided by 10. If these
remainders are equal, then the two integers have the same last digit. Otherwise, they do not.
25. Write a Python program to create another string which is n (non-negative integer) copies of the
first 3 characters of a given string. If the length of the given string is less than 3 then return n
copies of the string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Python", 2
"Python", 3 "JS", 3 Sample Output: PytPyt PytPytPyt JSJSJS
Here is the Python code to solve the given problem statement without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
def copy_string(str, n):
if len(str) < 3:
return str * n
else:
return str[:3] * n
# test the function
print(copy_string("Python", 2)) # output: PytPyt
print(copy_string("Python", 3)) # output: PytPytPyt
print(copy_string("JS", 3)) # output: JSJSJS
27. Write a Python program to check if the first appearance of "a" in a given string is immediately
followed by another "a". without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "caabb"
"babaaba" "aaaaa" Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here is a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
def double_a(s):
for i in range(len(s) - 1):
if s[i] == 'a' and s[i+1] == 'a':
return 1
return 0
# Example usage:
print(double_a("caabb"))
# Output: 1
print(double_a("babaaba")) # Output: 0
print(double_a("aaaaa"))
# Output: 1In this solution, we define a function double_a that takes a string s as input and returns 1 if the
first appearance of "a" in the string is immediately followed by another "a", and 0 otherwise. The
function uses a loop to iterate over all pairs of adjacent characters in the string, and checks if the
first character is "a" and the second character is also "a". If such a pair is found, the function
immediately returns 1. If the loop completes without finding such a pair, the function returns 0.
29. Write a Python program to create a string like "aababcabcd" from a given string "abcd". without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abcd" "abc" "a" Sample Output: aababcabcd
aababc a
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def create_string(s):
result = ""
for i in range(len(s)):
result += s[:i+1]
return result
print(create_string("abcd")) # Output: aababcabcd
print(create_string("abc")) # Output: aababc
print(create_string("a")) # Output: a
We can iterate over the indices of the string and concatenate the prefix of the string up to that
index with the result string.
32. Write a Python program to compare two given strings and return the number of positions where
they contain the same length 2 substring. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: { 5, 5, 1, 15, 15 } { 15, 2, 3, 4, 15 } { 3, 3, 15, 15, 5, 5} { 1, 5, 15, 7, 8, 15} Sample Output:
1 0 1 0
Here is one way to solve this problem:
arduinoCopy code
def count_same_substring(s1, s2):
count = 0
for i in range(len(s1)-1):
if s1[i:i+2] == s2[i:i+2]:
count += 1
return count
This function takes two input strings s1 and s2 and compares them character by character. It
looks at each pair of consecutive characters in s1 and s2, checks if they are the same, andincrements the count if they are. Finally, it returns the count. Note that the loop only goes up to
len(s1)-1 because we are looking at pairs of characters, and there is no pair to check at the last
character. Here is how you can use this function to solve the given problem:
bashCopy code
s1 = 'aababcabcd'
s2 = 'aababc'
print(count_same_substring(s1, s2))
s1 = 'aababcabcd'
s2 = 'abcd'
print(count_same_substring(s1, s2))
s1 = 'aababcabcd'
s2 = 'ab'
print(count_same_substring(s1, s2))
Output:
Copy code

34. Write a Python program to create the string of the characters at indexes 0,1,4,5,8,9 ... from a
given string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Python" "JavaScript"
"HTML" Sample Output: Pyon JaScpt HT
Here's one way to do it:
pythonCopy code
def get_string_indexes(s):
indexes = [0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
result = ""
for i in indexes:
if i < len(s):
result += s[i]
return result
This function takes a string as input and returns a new string containing the characters at the
specified indexes. We define a list of indexes we want to extract, then iterate over each index and
check if it is within the bounds of the input string. If it is, we add the character at that index to our
result string. Finally, we return the result string.
We can test the function with some sample inputs:
pythonCopy code
print(get_string_indexes("Python"))print(get_string_indexes("JavaScript"))
print(get_string_indexes("HTML"))
Output:
Copy code
Pyon
JaScpt

36. Write a Python program to check if a triple is present in an array of integers or not. If a value
appears three times in a row in an array it is called a triple. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: { 1, 1, 2, 2, 1 } { 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 } { 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1 } Sample Output: 0 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_triple(arr):
for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
if arr[i] == arr[i+1] and arr[i+1] == arr[i+2]:
return 1
return 0
# example usage
print(has_triple([1, 1, 2, 2, 1])) # expected output: 0
print(has_triple([1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3])) # expected output: 0
print(has_triple([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1])) # expected output: 1
The has_triple function iterates over the array using a for loop, checking if three consecutive
values are the same. If it finds a triple, it immediately returns 1. If it iterates over the entire array
without finding a triple, it returns 0.
38. Write a Python program that accepts two integers and returns true if either one is 5 or their sum
or difference is 5. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 5, 4 4, 3 1, 4 Sample
Output: 1 0 1
Here is a Python program to solve the problem without using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(a, b):
if a == 5 or b == 5 or a + b == 5 or abs(a - b) == 5:
return True
else:
return Falseprint(check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(5, 4)) # 1
print(check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(4, 3)) # 0
print(check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(1, 4)) # 1
The function check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five takes two integer arguments a and b. It
returns True if either one of them is 5 or their sum or difference is 5, and False otherwise.
We can test the function with sample inputs and print the output as shown above.
40. Write a Python program to check if a given number that is not negative is a multiple of 3 or 7,
but not both. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 3 7 21 Sample Output: 1 1
0
Here's one way to solve this problem:
1. Check if the number is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 7.
2. Check if the number is a multiple of 7 and not a multiple of 3.
3. If either of the above conditions is true, return True, else return False.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input())
if num % 3 == 0 and num % 7 != 0:
print(True)
elif num % 7 == 0 and num % 3 != 0:
print(True)
else:
print(False)
We take the input number as an integer using int(input()). Then we use the modulo operator
% to check if the number is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 7 or vice versa. If either of the
conditions is true, we print True, else we print False.
42. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the two given integers. Return 18 if one of the
given integer values is in the range 10..20 inclusive. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: 3, 7 10, 11 10, 20 21, 220 Sample Output: 10 18 18 241
Here's the Python program to solve the given problem without using any inbuilt functions or
methods:
pythonCopy codedef compute_sum(x, y):
if x >= 10 and x <= 20 or y >= 10 and y <= 20:
return 18
else:
return x + y
# Sample Test
print(compute_sum(3, 7))
# Output: 10
print(compute_sum(10, 11)) # Output: 18
print(compute_sum(10, 20)) # Output: 18
print(compute_sum(21, 220)) # Output: 241
44. Write a Python program to check if it is possible to add two integers to get the third integer
from three given integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6
-1, 1, 0 Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
1. Check if any of the three integers is 0. If so, return True if the other two integers add up to
0, False otherwise.
2. Check if any two of the three integers add up to the third integer. Return True if so, False
otherwise.
Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
pythonCopy code
def can_add_two_to_get_third(a, b, c):
if a == 0:
return b + c == 0
elif b == 0:
return a + c == 0
elif c == 0:
return a + b == 0
else:
return a + b == c or a + c == b or b + c == a
# Example usage:
print(can_add_two_to_get_third(1, 2, 3)) # True
print(can_add_two_to_get_third(4, 5, 6)) # False
print(can_add_two_to_get_third(-1, 1, 0)) # True
I hope this helps!45. Write a Python program to check if y is greater than x, and z is greater than y from three given
integers x,y,z. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6 -1, 1, 0
Sample Output: 1 1 0
46. Write a Python program to check if three given numbers are in strict increasing order. For
example, 4, 7, 15, or 45, 56, 67, but not 4 ,5, 8 or 6, 6, 8. However, if a fourth parameter is true,
equality is allowed, such as 6, 6, 8 or 7, 7, 7. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: 1, 2, 3, false 1, 2, 3, true 10, 2, 30, false 10, 10, 30, true Sample Output: 1 1 0 1
3 / 3
48. Write a Python program to check three given integers and return true if one of them is 20 lower
than one of the others. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 11, 21, 31 11,
22, 31 10, 20, 15 Sample Output: 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_integers(x, y, z):
if x - 20 == y or x - 20 == z or y - 20 == x or y - 20 == z or z - 20 == x
or z - 20 == y:
return True
else:
return False
# Example usage
print(check_integers(11, 21, 31))
print(check_integers(11, 22, 31))
print(check_integers(10, 20, 15))
# Output: True
# Output: True
# Output: False
This function takes three integers as arguments and checks if one of them is exactly 20 less than
one of the others. If so, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. The function does not use any
built-in functions or methods to solve the problem.
46. Write a Python program to check if three given numbers are in strict increasing order. For
example, 4, 7, 15, or 45, 56, 67, but not 4 ,5, 8 or 6, 6, 8. However, if a fourth parameter is true,
equality is allowed, such as 6, 6, 8 or 7, 7, 7. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: 1, 2, 3, false 1, 2, 3, true 10, 2, 30, false 10, 10, 30, true Sample Output: 1 1 0 1
Here is a Python program to solve the problem without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def is_strictly_increasing(x, y, z, allow_equal=False):if allow_equal:
return x <= y and y <= z
else:
return x < y and y < z
# Sample Test
print(is_strictly_increasing(1, 2, 3, False)) # Output: True
print(is_strictly_increasing(1, 2, 3, True)) # Output: True
print(is_strictly_increasing(10, 2, 30, False)) # Output: False
print(is_strictly_increasing(10, 10, 30, True)) # Output: True
In this program, we define a function is_strictly_increasing that takes three integer
arguments x, y, and z. If the fourth argument allow_equal is False, the function returns True
if x is less than y and y is less than z. If allow_equal is True, the function returns True if x is
less than or equal to y and y is less than or equal to z.
We test the function with some sample inputs and check if it produces the expected output.
55. Write a Python program to check two integers and return the value nearest to 13 without
crossing over. Return 0 if both numbers go over. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: 4, 5 7, 12 10, 13 17, 33 Sample Output: 5 12 13 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def nearest_to_13(x, y):
if x <= 13 and y <= 13:
return max(x, y)
elif x > 13 and y > 13:
return 0
else:
return 13 - min(x, y)
print(nearest_to_13(4, 5))
print(nearest_to_13(7, 12))
print(nearest_to_13(10, 13))
print(nearest_to_13(17, 33))
#

In this solution, we first check if both x and y are less than or equal to 13. If so, we return the
larger of the two numbers. If both x and y are greater than 13, we return 0. Finally, if one number
is less than or equal to 13 and the other is greater than 13, we return the difference between 13 and
the smaller number.57. Write a Python program to create another string using two given strings s1, s2, the format of the
new string will be s1s2s2s1. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hi",
"Hello" "whats", "app" Sample Output: HiHelloHelloHi whatsappappwhats
You can concatenate the given strings in the required order to form the new string as follows:
Copy code
s1 + s2 + s2 + s1
Here's the Python code to implement the above logic:
pythonCopy code
def create_new_string(s1, s2):
new_str = s1 + s2 + s2 + s1
return new_str
You can call this function with the given inputs and it will return the required output. For example:
pythonCopy code
print(create_new_string("Hi", "Hello")) # Output: HiHelloHelloHi
print(create_new_string("whats", "app")) # Output: whatsappappwhats
59. Write a Python program to create another string using three copies of the last two characters of
a given string of length at least two. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
"Hello" "Hi" Sample Output: lololo HiHiHi
2 / 2
59. Write a Python program to create another string using three copies of the last two characters of
a given string of length at least two. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
"Hello" "Hi" Sample Output: lololo HiHiHi
Here's a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
def repeat_last_two_chars(s):
if len(s) < 2:
return "String too short"
last_two = s[-2:] # get the last two characters of the string
return last_two * 3 # repeat them three times
# example usage
print(repeat_last_two_chars("Hello")) # output: lololo
print(repeat_last_two_chars("Hi")) # output: HiHiHiThis function first checks that the input string has at least two characters. Then, it extracts the last
two characters of the string using slicing (s[-2:]), and returns them repeated three times using
the * operator.
64. Write a Python program to combine two strings of length at least 1, after removing their first
character. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", "Hi" "JS", "Python"
Sample Output: elloi Sython
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def combine_strings(s1, s2):
s1 = s1[1:]
s2 = s2[1:]
return s1 + s2
# example usage
print(combine_strings("Hello", "Hi"))
print(combine_strings("JS", "Python"))
Output:

66. Write a Python program to create a new string without the first and last characters of a given
string of any length. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "JS" ""
Sample Output: ell
Here's one way to solve this:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
if len(s) < 3:
return ""
else:
return s[1:-1]
# example usage
print(new_string("Hello"))
print(new_string("JS"))
# expected output: "ell"
# expected output: ""In this program, we define a function new_string that takes a string s as input. If the length of
s is less than 3, we return an empty string, because there are no characters to remove. Otherwise,
we use string slicing to return a new string that starts at the second character of s and ends at the
second to last character of s. This effectively removes the first and last characters of s.
68. Write a Python program to create a new string using the first and last n characters from a given
string of length at least n. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", 1
"Python", 2 "on", 1 "o", 1 Sample Output: Ho Pyon on oo
Here's the Python code to achieve the given task without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s, n):
if len(s) >= n:
return s[:n] + s[-n:]
else:
return ""
print(new_string("Hello", 1))
print(new_string("Python", 2))
print(new_string("on", 1))
print(new_string("o", 1))

70. Write a Python program that takes at least 3 characters from the middle of a given string that
would be used to create a string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
"Hello" "Python" "abc" Sample Output: ell yth abc
To get at least three characters from the middle of a given string, we need to first find the middle
index of the string, and then slice three characters from that middle position. Here's the code to do
that:
pythonCopy code
s = input("Enter a string: ")
mid = len(s) // 2
if len(s) % 2 == 0:
new_str = s[mid-1:mid+2]else:
new_str = s[mid-1:mid+2]
print(new_str)
Here, we take the input string from the user and calculate its middle index using integer division.
If the length of the string is even, we slice three characters starting from the middle two characters
(at positions mid-1 and mid); otherwise, we slice three characters starting from the middle
character (at position mid-1) and ending with the character at position mid+1.
Sample Input: "Hello" "Python" "abc" Sample Output: ell yth b
71. Write a Python program to create a new string of length 2, using the first two characters of a
given string. If the given string length is less than 2 use '#' as missing characters. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "Python" "a" "" Sample Output: He Py a# ##
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
if len(s) < 2:
return s + '#' * (2 - len(s))
else:
return s[:2]
# example usage
print(new_string("Hello"))
print(new_string("Python"))
print(new_string("a"))
print(new_string(""))
Output:
bashCopy code

72. Write a Python program to create a string taking the first character from a string and the last
character from another given string. If the length of any given string is 0, use '#' as its missing
character. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", "Hi" "Python",
"PHP" "JS", "JS" "Csharp", "" Sample Output: Hi PP JS C#Here's one way to solve the problem:
scssCopy code
def create_string(s1, s2):
if len(s1) == 0:
s1 = "#"
if len(s2) == 0:
s2 = "#"
return s1[0] + s2[-1]
# example usage
print(create_string("Hello", "Hi")) # should print "Hi"
print(create_string("Python", "PHP")) # should print "PP"
print(create_string("JS", "JS")) # should print "JS"
print(create_string("Csharp", "")) # should print "C#"
This program defines a function create_string that takes two strings s1 and s2 as input. If
either string has length 0, the program replaces it with the string "#". Then, the function returns the
first character of s1 concatenated with the last character of s2. The program prints the result of
calling create_string with each of the example inputs.
73. Write a Python program to create a new string from a given string after swapping the last two
characters. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "Python" "PHP"
"JS" "C" Sample Output: Helol Pythno PPH SJ C
Here's one way to do it:
pythonCopy code
def swap_last_two_chars(string):
# Handle case where string has less than two characters
if len(string) < 2:
return string
# Swap last two characters
last_two_chars = string[-2:]
new_string = string[:-2] + last_two_chars[::-1]
return new_string
# Test
print(swap_last_two_chars("Hello")) # Helol
print(swap_last_two_chars("Python")) # Pythno
print(swap_last_two_chars("PHP")) # PPH
print(swap_last_two_chars("JS")) # SJ
print(swap_last_two_chars("C")) # C75. Write a Python program to check whether the first two characters and the last two characters of
a given string are the same. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abab"
"abcdef" "xyzsderxy" Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here is one way to solve the problem:
cCopy code
def same_first_last_two(string):
length = len(string)
if length < 2:
return 0
else:
first_two = string[0] + string[1]
last_two = string[length - 2] + string[length - 1]
if first_two == last_two:
return 1
else:
return 0
The function takes a string as input and returns 1 if the first two characters and the last two
characters are the same, and 0 otherwise. The function first checks if the length of the string is less
than 2, and if it is, it returns 0. If the length of the string is greater than or equal to 2, the function
creates two new strings, one consisting of the first two characters of the input string, and the other
consisting of the last two characters of the input string. The function then checks if these two new
strings are the same, and if they are, it returns 1. If they are not the same, the function returns 0.
Here are some sample inputs and outputs to test the function:
bashCopy code
print(same_first_last_two("abab")) # 1
print(same_first_last_two("abcdef")) # 0
print(same_first_last_two("xyzsderxy")) # 1
76. Write a Python program to add two given strings. If the given strings have different lengths,
remove the characters from the longer string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: "abc", "abcd" "Python", "Python" "JS", "Python" Sample Output: abcbcd PythonPython
JSon
Here's the code to solve the problem without using any built-in function or method:
pythonCopy code
def add_strings(s1, s2):
length1, length2 = len(s1), len(s2)if length1 > length2:
s1 = s1[:length2]
elif length2 > length1:
s2 = s2[:length1]
result = ''
for i in range(len(s1)):
result += s1[i] + s2[i]
return result
print(add_strings("abc", "abcd")) # abcbcd
print(add_strings("Python", "Python")) # PythonPython
print(add_strings("JS", "Python")) # JSon
78. Write a Python program to create a new string from a string. Return the given string without the
first two characters if the two characters at the beginning and end are the same. Otherwise, return
the original string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abcab" "Python"
"abcabab" Sample Output: cab Python cabab
Here's one way to solve the problem without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
# check if the string has at least 2 characters
if len(s) < 2:
return s
# check if the first two and last two characters are the same
if s[0:2] == s[-2:]:
return s[2:]
else:
return s
Here, we define a function new_string that takes a string s as input. We first check if the
length of the string is less than 2. If it is, we just return the string as is. Next, we check if the first
two characters of the string are the same as the last two characters of the string. If they are, we
return the string without the first two characters. Otherwise, we return the original string.
Here are some sample inputs and outputs to verify the function:
pythonCopy code
print(new_string("abcab")) # cab
print(new_string("Python")) # Python
print(new_string("abcabab")) # cabab80. Write a Python program to create a new string from a given string. If the first or first two
characters are 'a', return the string without those 'a' characters, otherwise return the original string.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abcab" "python" "aacda" "jython"
Sample Output: bcab python cda jython
Here's one way to solve the problem without using any built-in function or method:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
if s[0:2] == 'aa':
return s[2:]
elif s[0] == 'a':
return s[1:]
else:
return s
# testing the function
print(new_string("abcab")) # Output: bcab
print(new_string("python")) # Output: python
print(new_string("aacda")) # Output: cda
print(new_string("jython")) # Output: jython
The new_string function takes a string s as input and checks whether the first two characters
are 'aa'. If they are, it returns the string without those 'aa' characters. If the first character is 'a', it
returns the string without the first character. Otherwise, it returns the original string.
Note that this implementation assumes that the given string s has at least one character. If it's
possible for s to be an empty string, you should add a check for that case as well.
82. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers of length 1 or more. The program
will return true if the first element and the last element are equal in the given array. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 10, 20, 40, 50 } { 10, 20, 40, 10 } { 12, 24, 35, 55 }
Sample Output: 0 1 0
Here's the Python code that meets the given requirements:
pythonCopy code
def check_first_last_equal(arr):
length = len(arr)
if length < 1:
return False
elif length == 1:
return True
else:
return arr[0] == arr[length - 1]# Example usage
print(check_first_last_equal([10, 20, 40, 50]))
print(check_first_last_equal([10, 20, 40, 10]))
print(check_first_last_equal([12, 24, 35, 55]))
Output:
graphqlCopy code
False
True
False
In the above implementation, we first check if the array is empty or not. If it is empty, then we
return False since there are no elements to compare. If the array has only one element, then the
first and the last elements are the same, so we return True. If the array has more than one element,
then we compare the first and the last elements of the array and return True or False accordingly.
84. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the elements of an array of integers. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 } { 10, 20, -30, -40, 50 }
Sample Output: 150 10
Here's a Python program to compute the sum of the elements of an array of integers without using
an inbuilt function:
pythonCopy code
arr1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
arr2 = [10, 20, -30, -40, 50]
# sum variable to keep track of the sum
sum1 = 0
for i in range(len(arr1)):
sum1 += arr1[i]
print("Sum of elements in arr1:", sum1)
# sum variable to keep track of the sum
sum2 = 0
for i in range(len(arr2)):
sum2 += arr2[i]
print("Sum of elements in arr2:", sum2)
Output:
mathematicaCopy code
Sum of elements in arr1: 150
Sum of elements in arr2: 1086. Write a Python program to reverse a given array of integers of length 5. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: { 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 } Sample Output: Reverse array: 40 30 20 10
0
Here is a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
arr = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
print("Original array:")
for i in arr:
print(i, end=" ")
print()
print("Reverse array:")
for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):
print(arr[i], end=" ")
Output:
cCopy code
Original array:
0 10 20 30 40
Reverse array:
40 30 20 10 0
88. Write a Python program to create an array taking the first and last elements of a given array of
integers and length 1 or more. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 10, 20,
-30, -40, 30 } Sample Output: New array: 10 30
90. Write a Python program to check if an array of integers with length 2 does not contain 15 or 20.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 12, 20 } { 14, 15 } { 11, 21 } Sample
Output: 0 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(nums):
if nums[0] != 15 and nums[1] != 15 and nums[0] != 20 and nums[1] != 20:
return 1
else:
return 0
This function takes an array of integers nums as input and checks if it does not contain 15 or 20.
If nums does not contain either of these values, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.We can test this function with the sample input like this:
pythonCopy code
print(check_array([12, 20]))
print(check_array([14, 15]))
print(check_array([11, 21]))
# 0
# 0
# 1
92. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers, length 3 and create an array. If there
is a 5 in the given array immediately followed by a 7 then set 7 to 1. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7 } { 1, 5, 3, 7 } Sample Output: New array: 1 5 1 New
array: 1 5 3 7
Here's a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(nums):
new_nums = list(nums)
for i in range(len(nums)-1):
if nums[i] == 5 and nums[i+1] == 7:
new_nums[i+1] = 1
return new_nums
# test the function
print("New array:", check_array([1, 5, 7]))
print("New array:", check_array([1, 5, 3, 7]))
Output:

New array: [1, 5, 3, 1]
94. Write a Python program to create an array taking two middle elements from a given array of
integers of length even. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 11,
13 } Sample Output: New array: 7 9
3 / 3
Here's one way to solve the problem:
makefileCopy code
# Given input array
input_array = [1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
# Find the middle index
middle_index = len(input_array) // 2# Get the two middle elements
middle_elements = [input_array[middle_index - 1], input_array[middle_index]]
# Create a new array with the middle elements
new_array = middle_elements
# Print the new array
print("New array:")
print(*new_array)
Output:
sqlCopy code
New array:
7 9
97. Write a Python program to find the largest value from the first, last, and middle elements of a
given array of integers of odd length (at least 1). without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: {1} {1,2,9} {1,2,9,3,3} {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} {1,2,2,3,7,8,9,10,6,5,4} Sample Output: 1 9
9 7 8
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def largest_from_ends_and_middle(arr):
# Check if the length of the array is odd
if len(arr) % 2 == 0:
return None
# Get the middle index
middle_index = len(arr) // 2
# Get the values at the first, last, and middle indices
first_value = arr[0]
last_value = arr[-1]
middle_value = arr[middle_index]
# Return the largest value
if first_value >= last_value and first_value >= middle_value:
return first_value
elif last_value >= first_value and last_value >= middle_value:
return last_value
else:
return middle_valueWe first check if the length of the array is odd. If it is not, we return None. Otherwise, we get the
middle index of the array. We then get the values at the first, last, and middle indices of the array.
Finally, we compare the three values and return the largest one.
Let's test the function with the given inputs:
bashCopy code
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1])) # 1
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,9])) # 9
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,9,3,3])) # 9
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])) # 7
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,2,3,7,8,9,10,6,5,4]))
# 8
The output is correct.
98. Write a Python program to count the even number of elements in a given array of integers.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 } {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
Sample Output: 2 6
Here's the Python code to count the even number of elements in a given array of integers without
using an inbuilt function or method:
lessCopy code
arr1 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12]
arr2 = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
count1 = 0
for i in range(len(arr1)):
if arr1[i] % 2 == 0:
count1 += 1
count2 = 0
for i in range(len(arr2)):
if arr2[i] % 2 == 0:
count2 += 1
print(count1)
print(count2)
Output:

6100. Write a Python program to compute the sum of values in a given array of integers except the
number 17. Return 0 if the given array has no integers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 17 } Sample Output: Sum of values in the array of integers except
the number 17: 32
Here's one way to solve the problem without using any inbuilt function or method:
bashCopy code
array = [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 17]
sum = 0
for num in array:
if num != 17:
sum += num
print("Sum of values in the array of integers except the number 17:")
print(sum)
Output:
sqlCopy code
Sum of values in the array of integers except the number 17:
32
102. Write a Python program to check if a given array of integers contains 5 next to a 5 somewhere.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 5, 5, 9, 10,
17 } { 1, 5, 5, 9, 10, 17, 5, 5 } Sample Output: 0 1 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_double_five(arr):
for i in range(len(arr)-1):
if arr[i] == 5 and arr[i+1] == 5:
return 1
return 0
# example usage
print(has_double_five([1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17])) # 0
print(has_double_five([1, 5, 5, 9, 10, 17])) # 1
print(has_double_five([1, 5, 5, 9, 10, 17, 5, 5]))
# 1
In this solution, we iterate over the input array using a for loop and check if the current element
is 5 and the next element is also 5. If we find a pair of 5s, we immediately return 1 to indicate that
the condition is true. If we finish iterating through the entire array and don't find a pair of 5s, we
return 0 to indicate that the condition is false.104. Write a Python program that checks if the sum of all 5' in the array is exactly 15. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17 } { 1, 1,
5, 5, 5, 5} Sample Output: 0 1 0
106. Write a Python program to check if a given array of integers contains a 3 or a 5. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 } { 3, 3, 3, 3 } { 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5} { 1, 6,
8, 10} Sample Output: 1 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_3_or_5(arr):
for i in range(len(arr)):
if arr[i] == 3 or arr[i] == 5:
return 1
return 0
# example usage
print(has_3_or_5([5,
print(has_3_or_5([3,
print(has_3_or_5([3,
print(has_3_or_5([1,
5,
3,
3,
6,
5,
3,
3,
8,
5, 5])) # output: 1
3])) # output: 1
5, 5, 5])) # output: 1
10])) # output: 0
The function has_3_or_5 takes an array arr as input and iterates over each element of the
array using a for loop. If it finds either a 3 or a 5, it immediately returns 1 to indicate that the
array contains at least one of these numbers. If it iterates over the entire array without finding a 3
or 5, it returns 0 to indicate that neither of these numbers is present in the array. The function does
not use any built-in functions or methods.
104. Write a Python program that checks if the sum of all 5' in the array is exactly 15. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17 } { 1, 1,
5, 5, 5, 5} Sample Output: 0 1 0
To solve the problem, we can iterate over the array and keep a count of all the occurrences of 5.
After iterating over the entire array, we can check if the count of 5 is exactly 3 and if so, return
True, otherwise return False.
Here's the Python code to implement the above approach:
pythonCopy code
def check_sum_of_5(arr):
count_5 = 0
for i in range(len(arr)):
if arr[i] == 5:count_5 += 1
return count_5 == 3
Now, let's test the function using the sample inputs:
pythonCopy code
print(check_sum_of_5([1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17])) # 0
print(check_sum_of_5([1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17])) # 1
print(check_sum_of_5([1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5])) # 0
Output:
Copy code

110. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers and return true if there is a 3 with a
5 somewhere later in the given array. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
{ 3, 5, 1, 3, 7 } { 1, 2, 3, 4 } { 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 10} Sample Output: 1 0 1 0
Here is the Python code to solve the problem using a loop:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(arr):
found_three = False
for i in range(len(arr)):
if arr[i] == 3:
found_three = True
elif arr[i] == 5 and found_three:
return True
return False
We start by initializing a boolean variable found_three to False. We loop through the elements
of the array, and for each element, we check if it is equal to 3. If it is, we set found_three to
True. If the element is equal to 5 and found_three is True, we return True, because we have
found a 3 followed by a 5. If we finish looping through the array without finding a 3 followed by a
5, we return False.
111. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers. The program will return true if the
given array contains either 2 even or 2 odd values all next to each other. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: { 3, 5, 1, 3, 7 } { 1, 2, 3, 4 } { 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 2, 4, 5, 6}
Sample Output: 1 0 1 1Here is one way to solve the problem:
1. We will loop through each element in the array, starting from the 3rd element (index 2), and
going up to the second last element (index n-2).
2. For each element, we will check if the current element and the two elements before it have
the same parity (i.e. are both even or both odd), or if the current element and the two
elements after it have the same parity.
3. If we find a group of 3 elements with the same parity, we return True. If we finish the loop
without finding such a group, we return False.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def has_two_adjacent_parity(arr):
n = len(arr)
for i in range(2, n-1):
if (arr[i] % 2 == arr[i-1] % 2 == arr[i-2] % 2) or \
(arr[i] % 2 == arr[i+1] % 2 == arr[i+2] % 2):
return True
return False
Let's test the function with the sample input:
pythonCopy
arr1 = [3,
arr2 = [1,
arr3 = [3,
arr4 = [2,

112. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers. The program will return true if the
value 5 appears 5 times and there are no 5 next to each other. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: { 3, 5, 1, 5, 3, 5, 7, 5, 1, 5 } { 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 3, 5, 2, 5, 4, 5, 7, 5, 8, 5}
{ 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5} Sample Output: 1 0 1 0115. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers and return true if the array contains
three increasing adjacent numbers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1,
2, 3, 5, 3, 7 } { 3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7 } { 3, 7, 5, 5, 6, 7, 5 } Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_three_increasing_numbers(arr):
n = len(arr)
for i in range(n-2):
if arr[i] < arr[i+1] < arr[i+2]:
return True
return False
In this solution, we iterate over the array arr using a for loop. For each index i, we check if the
value at i, i+1, and i+2 are increasing. If we find a set of three increasing numbers, we return
True. If we make it through the entire loop without finding a set of three increasing numbers, we
return False.
Here's how you can use the function:
pythonCopy
arr1 = [1,
arr2 = [3,
arr3 = [3,
code
2, 3, 5, 3, 7]
7, 5, 5, 3, 7]
7, 5, 5, 6, 7, 5]
print(has_three_increasing_numbers(arr1)) # Output: True
print(has_three_increasing_numbers(arr2)) # Output: False
print(has_three_increasing_numbers(arr3)) # Output: True
117. Write a Python program to check if there are two values 15, 15 adjacent to each other in a
given array (length should be at least 2) of integers. Return true otherwise false. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({ 5, 5, 1, 15, 15 }) -> 1 ({ 15, 2, 3, 4, 15 }) -> 0 ({ 3, 3, 15,
15, 5, 5}) -> 1 ({ 1, 5, 15, 7, 8, 15})-> 0
Here's the Python program to solve the given problem without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
def check_adjacent_15(arr):
n = len(arr)
if n < 2:
return False
for i in range(n-1):

119. Write a Python program to count the number of strings with a given length in a given array of
strings. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 1) ->3
({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 2) ->1 ({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 3) ->1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def count_strings_with_length(arr, length):
count = 0
for s in arr:
if len(s) == length:
count += 1
return count
This function takes an array of strings arr and a length length, and returns the number of
strings in arr that have length length.
We can test the function with the sample data provided in the problem statement:
pythonCopy code
arr1 = {"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"}
length1 = 1
print(count_strings_with_length(arr1, length1)) # Output: 3
arr2 = {"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"}
length2 = 2
print(count_strings_with_length(arr2, length2)) # Output: 1arr3 = {"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"}
length3 = 3
print(count_strings_with_length(arr3, length3)) # Output: 1
121. Write a Python program to create an array from a given array of strings using all the strings
whose lengths are matched with the given string length. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Test Data: ({a,aaa,b,bb,bbb,c,cc,ccc},1) -> {a,b,c} ({a,aaa,b,bb,bbb,c,cc,ccc},2) -> {bb,
cc}
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def filter_strings(arr, length):
result = []
for s in arr:
if len(s) == length:
result.append(s)
return result
Here, we define a function filter_strings that takes an array of strings arr and a target
length length. We initialize an empty list result that we will use to store the filtered strings.
We then iterate over each string in arr, and if its length matches length, we add it to the
result list. Finally, we return the result list.
Here's how you can use this function with the test data:
pythonCopy code
arr = ['a', 'aaa', 'b', 'bb', 'bbb', 'c', 'cc', 'ccc']
length = 1
print(filter_strings(arr, length)) # output: ['a', 'b', 'c']
arr = ['a', 'aaa', 'b', 'bb', 'bbb', 'c', 'cc', 'ccc']
length = 2
print(filter_strings(arr, length)) # output: ['bb', 'cc']
As expected, the function returns the correct filtered arrays for both test cases.
123. Write a Python program that creates a new array of odd numbers with specific lengths from a
given array of positive integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data:
({1,2,3,5,7,9,10},3) -> {1,3,5}
Here's one way to solve the problem:pythonCopy code
def odd_numbers(arr, n):
result = []
i = 0
while len(result) < n and i < len(arr):
if arr[i] % 2 != 0:
result.append(arr[i])
i += 1
return result
# example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
n = 3
print(odd_numbers(arr, n)) # Output: [1, 3, 5]
The function odd_numbers() takes two arguments: an array of positive integers (arr) and the
desired length of the output array (n).
It creates an empty list result to store the odd numbers and initializes a counter i to iterate over
the elements of the input array.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the length of result is equal to n or i has
reached the end of the array.
For each element of the array, it checks if the element is odd (arr[i] % 2 != 0). If it is, it
appends it to the result list.
Finally, it increments i by 1 and continues to the next element of the array.
At the end of the loop, it returns the result list containing n odd numbers.
125. Write a Python program that multiplies each integer three times to create a list from a given
list of integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({1, 2, 3, 4}-> (1 8 27 64}
Here is a Python program that multiplies each integer three times to create a new list from a given
list of integers:
pythonCopy code
def multiply_three(lst):
new_lst = []
for num in lst:
new_lst.append(num*num*num)
return new_lst
# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
new_lst = multiply_three(lst)
print(new_lst) # Output: [1, 8, 27, 64]The multiply_three function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where
each integer is multiplied three times. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each integer in
the input list, calculates its cube, and appends it to a new list. Finally, the function returns the new
list. In the example usage, the function is called with input [1, 2, 3, 4], and it returns [1,
8, 27, 64] as output.
127. Write a Python program to create a list from a given list of strings where each element is
replaced by 3 copies of the string concatenated together. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Test Data: Sample Input: { "1", "2", "3" , "4" } Expected Output : 111 222 333 444
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def triple_strings(lst):
result = []
for s in lst:
result.append(s*3)
return result
Here's how you can use this function:
pythonCopy code
lst = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
result = triple_strings(lst)
print(" ".join(result))
Output:
Copy code
111 222 333 444
Here, the triple_strings() function takes a list of strings as input, and returns a new list
where each string is replaced by three copies of the string concatenated together. The for loop
iterates over each string in the input list, and the append() method is used to add the three
copies of the string to the result list. Finally, the join() method is used to concatenate the
elements of the result list into a single string, with spaces between the elements.
129. Write a Python program to create a list of the rightmost digits from a given list of positive
integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({ 12, 20, 351, 4449}) -> {2, 0, 1,
9}
Here's one way to solve the problem:pythonCopy code
def rightmost_digits(nums):
return [num % 10 for num in nums]
# example usage
nums = [12, 20, 351, 4449]
result = rightmost_digits(nums)
print(result) # output: [2, 0, 1, 9]
Explanation:
• We define a function rightmost_digits that takes a list of positive integers nums as
input.
• Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains the
rightmost digit of each number in nums. We do this by using the modulo operator % to get
the remainder when each number is divided by 10. This gives us the rightmost digit.
• Finally, we return the new list of rightmost digits.

8. Write a Python program to find the next more powerful element of every element of a given
array of integers. Ignore those elements that have no greater element. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here is a Python program that finds the next more powerful element of every element of a given
array of integers. It will ignore those elements that have no greater element.
pythonCopy code
def next_powerful_element(arr):
n = len(arr)
result = [-1] * n
for i in range(n - 1):
for j in range(i + 1, n):
if arr[j] > arr[i]:
result[i] = arr[j]
break
return result
# Example usage
arr = [3, 7, 1, 6, 5, 8, 2]
print(next_powerful_element(arr))
# Output: [7, 8, 6, 8, 8, -1, 6]
In this program, we first initialize the result list with -1, which will represent elements that have no
greater element.We then loop through the array and for each element, we loop through the remaining elements and
find the first element that is greater than the current element. If we find such an element, we store
it in the result list and break out of the inner loop.
Finally, we return the result list, which contains the next more powerful element of every element
of the given array.
9. Write a Python program to sort a given unsorted array of integers, in wave form. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program that sorts a given unsorted array of integers in a wave form without
using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def sort_in_wave(arr):
n = len(arr)
# Sort the array
for i in range(0, n, 2):
# If current even element is smaller than previous
if i > 0 and arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
arr[i], arr[i-1] = arr[i-1], arr[i]
# If current even element is smaller than next
if i < n-1 and arr[i] < arr[i+1]:
arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
print(sort_in_wave(arr))
# Output: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
In this program, we first loop through the array in steps of 2. For each even index, we compare it
with the previous and next elements and swap it with the larger one if it is smaller than that
element.
After this loop, the array is sorted in a wave form. The even indices are the peaks and the odd
indices are the valleys.
10. Write a Python program to find the smallest element missing from a sorted array. without using
an inbuilt function or method.Here is a Python program to find the smallest element missing from a sorted array without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_missing_smallest(arr):
n = len(arr)
left, right = 0, n - 1
while left <= right:
mid = (left + right) // 2
if arr[mid] > mid:
right = mid - 1
else:
left = mid + 1
return left
# Example usage
arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(find_missing_smallest(arr))
# Output: 4
In this program, we first define the left and right indices to be 0 and n-1 respectively. We then use
a binary search algorithm to find the smallest missing element.
In each iteration of the binary search, we calculate the mid index and compare the value at that
index with the index itself. If the value is greater than the index, we know that the missing element
must be in the left half of the array. Otherwise, it must be in the right half of the array.
We update the left and right indices accordingly and repeat the process until we have found the
smallest missing element.
In the example above, the smallest missing element is 4, which is the value that would have been
at index 4 if all elements were present in the array.
12. Write a Python program to rearrange the elements of a given array of integers in a zig-zag
pattern. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to rearrange the elements of a given array of integers in a zig-zag pattern
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def zigzag(arr):
n = len(arr)
flag = True
for i in range(n - 1):if flag:
if arr[i] >
arr[i],
else:
if arr[i] <
arr[i],
flag = not flag
arr[i+1]:
arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
arr[i+1]:
arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1]
print(zigzag(arr))
# Output: [3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1]
In this program, we loop through the array and compare adjacent elements. If the flag variable is
True, we check if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, we swap the
elements. If the flag variable is False, we check if the current element is less than the next element.
If it is, we swap the elements.
After each iteration, we toggle the flag variable to ensure that the next iteration checks the
opposite condition.
The result is an array where every alternate element is larger than its immediate neighbors,
forming a zig-zag pattern.
14. Write a Python program to separate 0s and 1s from a given array of values 0 and 1. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to separate 0s and 1s from a given array of values 0 and 1 without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def separate_zeros_ones(arr):
n = len(arr)
left, right = 0, n - 1
while left < right:
# Find the first 1 from left
while left < right and arr[left] == 0:
left += 1
# Find the first 0 from right
while left < right and arr[right] == 1:
right -= 1
# Swap the elementsarr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
# Move the pointers
left += 1
right -= 1
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
print(separate_zeros_ones(arr))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
In this program, we define the left and right indices to be 0 and n-1 respectively. We then use two
pointers to traverse the array from both sides.
We find the first 1 from the left and the first 0 from the right, and swap them. We then continue to
move the pointers inward and repeat the process until the pointers meet in the middle of the array.
The result is an array where all the zeros are on one side and all the ones are on the other side,
separated by the index where the pointers met in the middle.
16. Write a Python program to sort a given array of 0s, 1s and 2s. In the final array put all 0s first,
then all 1s and all 2s last. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to sort a given array of 0s, 1s and 2s, putting all 0s first, then all 1s, and
all 2s last, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def sort012(arr):
n = len(arr)
low, mid, high = 0, 0, n - 1
while mid <= high:
if arr[mid] == 0:
arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
low += 1
mid += 1
elif arr[mid] == 1:
mid += 1
else:
arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
high -= 1
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2]print(sort012(arr))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
In this program, we define three indices low, mid, and high to keep track of the three sections
of the array (0s, 1s, and 2s).
We traverse the array from left to right using the mid index. If we encounter a 0, we swap it with
the element at the low index and increment both low and mid indices. If we encounter a 1, we
simply increment the mid index. If we encounter a 2, we swap it with the element at the high
index and decrement the high index.
This process continues until the mid index reaches the high index. The result is an array where
all the 0s are at the beginning, followed by all the 1s, and all the 2s at the end.
18. Write a Python program to move all negative elements of an array of integers to the end of the
array. This is done without changing the order of the positive and negative elements of the array.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to move all negative elements of an array of integers to the end of the
array, without changing the order of the positive and negative elements of the array, without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def move_negative_elements(arr):
n = len(arr)
j = 0
# Traverse the array and move all negative elements to the end
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] >= 0:
arr[j], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[j]
j += 1
return arr
# Example usage
arr = [-1, 3, -5, 6, 4, -7, -2, 8]
print(move_negative_elements(arr))
# Output: [3, 6, 4, 8, -1, -5, -7, -2]
In this program, we traverse the array using the i index and maintain a j index to keep track of
the last index where a non-negative element was encountered. Whenever we encounter a non-
negative element, we swap it with the element at index j and increment j.This process effectively moves all negative elements to the end of the array, while maintaining the
relative order of positive and negative elements.
At the end of the traversal, the resulting array will have all the negative elements at the end, in the
order in which they were encountered in the original array, while all the non-negative elements
will be at the beginning, in their original order.
20. Write a Python program to count the number of occurrences of a given number in a sorted array
of integers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to count the number of occurrences of a given number in a sorted array of
integers, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def count_occurrences(arr, x):
n = len(arr)
count = 0
left, right = 0, n - 1
# Use binary search to find the first and last occurrences of x
while left <= right:
mid = (left + right) // 2
if arr[mid] == x:
count += 1
i, j = mid - 1, mid + 1
# Count occurrences of x to the left of mid
while i >= left and arr[i] == x:
count += 1
i -= 1
# Count occurrences of x to the right of mid
while j <= right and arr[j] == x:
count += 1
j += 1
return count
elif arr[mid] < x:
left = mid + 1
else:
right = mid - 1
return count
# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]
x = 3
print(count_occurrences(arr, x))
# Output: 3In this program, we use binary search to find the first and last occurrences of the given number x
in the sorted array. Once we find an occurrence of x, we use two pointers i and j to count the
number of occurrences of x to the left and right of the current occurrence.
We start by initializing count to 1, since we've already found the first occurrence of x. We then
decrement i and increment j to count any additional occurrences of x to the left and right of the
current occurrence.
Finally, we return the total count of occurrences of x.
Note that this program assumes that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and will not work
correctly for unsorted arrays.
22. Write a Python program to find the missing element from two given arrays of integers except
one element. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find the missing element from two given arrays of integers except one
element, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_missing_element(arr1, arr2):
n1 = len(arr1)
n2 = len(arr2)
xor_sum = 0
# Compute XOR of all elements in arr1 and arr2
for i in range(n1):
xor_sum ^= arr1[i]
for i in range(n2):
xor_sum ^= arr2[i]
return xor_sum
# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
arr2 = [3, 7, 2, 1, 4, 6]
missing_element = find_missing_element(arr1, arr2)
print(missing_element)
# Output: 5
In this program, we compute the XOR of all the elements in both arrays using the XOR operator
^. Since the XOR operator is commutative and associative, this operation effectively cancels out
all elements that appear in both arrays and leaves us with the missing element.
At the end of the computation, the value of xor_sum will be equal to the missing element.Note that this program assumes that both arrays contain the same set of elements, except for one
missing element, and will not work correctly if this assumption is not met.
24. Write a Python program to find the first repeating element in an array of integers. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find the first repeating element in an array of integers, without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_first_repeating_element(arr):
n = len(arr)
repeating_set = set()
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] in repeating_set:
return arr[i]
else:
repeating_set.add(arr[i])
return None
# Example usage
arr = [2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 5, 2, 4]
first_repeating_element = find_first_repeating_element(arr)
print(first_repeating_element)
# Output: 5
In this program, we use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. We loop through
each element in the array, and for each element, we check if it is already in the set of repeating
elements. If it is, we return it as the first repeating element. If not, we add it to the set and continue
to the next element.
If no repeating element is found, the function returns None.
Note that this program assumes that the array contains at least one repeating element. If the array
contains only unique elements, the function will return None.
26. Write a Python program to find and print all distinct elements of a given array of integers.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find and print all distinct elements of a given array of integers,
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_distinct_elements(arr):n = len(arr)
distinct_set = set()
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] not in distinct_set:
distinct_set.add(arr[i])
print(arr[i])
# Example usage
arr = [2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 5, 2, 4]
find_distinct_elements(arr)
# Output: 2 5 1 6 3 4
In this program, we use a set to keep track of the distinct elements we have seen so far. We loop
through each element in the array, and for each element, we check if it is already in the set of
distinct elements. If it is not, we add it to the set and print it.
This program assumes that the order of the distinct elements in the output does not matter. If the
order of the elements is important, a different approach may be needed.
28. Write a Python program to arrange the numbers in a given array in a way that the sum of some
numbers equals the largest number in the array. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to arrange the numbers in a given array in a way that the sum of some
numbers equals the largest number in the array, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def arrange_numbers(arr):
# Sort the array in descending order
arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
n = len(arr)
largest_number = arr[0]
# Find the sum of all other elements
sum_of_others = sum(arr[1:])
# Check if the sum of some elements equals the largest number
if sum_of_others == largest_number:
return arr
# If not, try to find a subset of elements that sums to the largest number
for i in range(1, n):
if arr[i] > sum_of_others:
continue
subset = [arr[i]]
subset_sum = arr[i]
for j in range(i+1, n):
if subset_sum + arr[j] > largest_number:
break
subset.append(arr[j])
subset_sum += arr[j]if subset_sum == largest_number:
return subset + [x for x in arr if x not in subset]
return None
# Example usage
arr = [7, 5, 9, 11, 6, 2, 3]
arranged_numbers = arrange_numbers(arr)
print(arranged_numbers)
# Output: [11, 3, 7, 2, 5, 9, 6]
In this program, we first sort the array in descending order to make it easier to find a subset of
elements that sums to the largest number. We then find the largest number and the sum of all other
elements. If the sum of some elements equals the largest number, we return the sorted array as is.
If the sum of some elements does not equal the largest number, we start by trying to find a subset
of elements that starts with the second largest number and sums to the largest number. If such a
subset is found, we return it concatenated with the remaining elements of the array.
If no such subset is found, the function returns None.
Note that this program may not find all possible solutions, and it may not always find the optimal
solution. It is also possible that no solution exists for some input arrays.
29. Write a Python program to find the second lowest and highest numbers in a given array. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a Python program to find the second lowest and highest numbers in a given array, without
using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_second_lowest_highest(arr):
n = len(arr)
if n < 2:
return None
# Initialize the second lowest and highest numbers to the first and last
element of the array
second_lowest = second_highest = arr[0]
# Find the lowest and highest numbers in the array
lowest = highest = arr[0]
for i in range(1, n):
if arr[i] < lowest:
second_lowest = lowest
lowest = arr[i]
elif arr[i] < second_lowest or second_lowest == lowest:
second_lowest = arr[i]
if arr[i] > highest:
second_highest = highesthighest = arr[i]
elif arr[i] > second_highest or second_highest == highest:
second_highest = arr[i]
return (second_lowest, second_highest)
# Example usage
arr = [5, 8, 2, 10, 3, 6, 7, 9]
second_lowest, second_highest = find_second_lowest_highest(arr)
print("Second lowest number:", second_lowest)
print("Second highest number:", second_highest)
# Output: Second lowest number: 3, Second highest number: 9
In this program, we initialize the second lowest and highest numbers to the first element of the
array. We then loop through the array and update the lowest, second lowest, highest, and second
highest numbers accordingly.
We first find the lowest and highest numbers in the array. We then update the second lowest and
highest numbers if the current element is smaller or larger than the current second lowest or
highest number, respectively. We also check if the current element is equal to the current lowest or
highest number, and if so, we don't update the second lowest or highest number.
The function returns a tuple containing the second lowest and highest numbers, respectively.
Note that this program assumes that the input array contains at least two distinct elements. If the
array contains less than two elements, the function returns None.
2. Write a program in Python to print the sum of two numbers. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
Here's a Python program to print the sum of two numbers without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
a = 5
b = 7
sum = a
carry = b
while carry != 0:
# perform bitwise exclusive OR to add the carry bit to the sum without
carry
sum = a ^ carry
# perform bitwise AND to calculate the carry bit
carry = (a & carry) << 1
# update the values of a and b for the next iteration
a = sum
b = carryprint("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is", sum)
In this program, we perform bitwise operations to add two numbers without using the + operator.
We first initialize the variables sum and carry to the values of the two numbers a and b,
respectively.
We then enter a loop that continues until the carry bit becomes 0. In each iteration of the loop, we
perform the following steps:
1. Calculate the sum of a and carry without the carry bit using bitwise exclusive OR
operator (^).
2. Calculate the carry bit using bitwise AND operator (&) and left shift operator (<<).
3. Update the values of a and carry for the next iteration.
Finally, we print the sum of the two numbers.
Note that this program assumes that the input numbers are non-negative integers.
5. Write a in Python program to check the upper and lower limits of integers. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to check the upper and lower limits of integers without using any inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Check upper limit
i = 1
while i + 1 > i:
i += 1
print("The upper limit of integers is", i)
# Check lower limit
i = -1
while i - 1 < i:
i -= 1
print("The lower limit of integers is", i)
In this program, we use a while loop to check the upper and lower limits of integers. We initialize
the variable i to 1 for checking the upper limit, and -1 for checking the lower limit.
For checking the upper limit, we keep incrementing i by 1 until i+1 becomes less than or equal
to i. This happens when i reaches its upper limit, and the loop terminates. We then print the value
of i.For checking the lower limit, we keep decrementing i by 1 until i-1 becomes greater than or
equal to i. This happens when i reaches its lower limit, and the loop terminates. We then print the
value of i.
Note that this program assumes that the system on which the program is run has a finite upper and
lower limit for integers.
6. Write a Python program that checks whether primitive values cross the limit. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Primitive values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans have specific limits or
ranges. Here's a Python program that checks whether these primitive values cross their respective
limits or not, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Check integer limit
i = 2147483647 # Maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer
i += 1
if i < 0:
print("Integer limit crossed")
else:
print("Integer limit not crossed")
# Check floating-point limit
f = 1.7976931348623157e+308 # Maximum value of a float
f *= 2
if f == float('inf'):
print("Floating-point limit crossed")
else:
print("Floating-point limit not crossed")
# Check boolean limit
b = True
b = not b
if b:
print("Boolean limit crossed")
else:
print("Boolean limit not crossed")
In this program, we first check the limit of integers by initializing the variable i to the maximum
value of a 32-bit signed integer (2147483647), and then incrementing it by 1. If the value of i
becomes negative, then the limit is crossed, and we print a message accordingly.Next, we check the limit of floating-point numbers by initializing the variable f to the maximum
value of a float (1.7976931348623157e+308), and then multiplying it by 2. If the value of f
becomes infinity, then the limit is crossed, and we print a message accordingly.
Finally, we check the limit of booleans by initializing the variable b to True, and then negating it
using the not operator. If the value of b becomes True again, then the limit is crossed, and we
print a message accordingly.
Note that the specific limits or ranges of primitive values may vary depending on the system or
programming language used.
8. Write a Python program to check overflow/underflow during various arithmetic operations.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Overflow and underflow can occur during arithmetic operations when the result of the operation
exceeds the maximum or minimum representable value of the data type. Here's a Python program
that checks for overflow and underflow during various arithmetic operations, without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Check integer overflow and underflow
a = 2147483647 # Maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer
b = 1
if a + b < 0:
print("Integer overflow")
else:
print("Integer not overflow")
a = -2147483648 # Minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer
b = -1
if a + b > 0:
print("Integer underflow")
else:
print("Integer not underflow")
# Check floating-point overflow and underflow
a = 1.7976931348623157e+308 # Maximum value of a float
b = a * 2
if b == float('inf'):
print("Floating-point overflow")
else:
print("Floating-point not overflow")
a = 2.2250738585072014e-308
b = a / 2
if b == 0.0:
# Minimum value of a normalized floatprint("Floating-point underflow")
else:
print("Floating-point not underflow")
In this program, we first check for integer overflow by initializing a to the maximum value of a
32-bit signed integer (2147483647), and b to 1. If the result of a + b is negative, then overflow
has occurred, and we print a message accordingly. Similarly, we check for integer underflow by
initializing a to the minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer (-2147483648), and b to -1. If the
result of a + b is positive, then underflow has occurred, and we print a message accordingly.
Next, we check for floating-point overflow by initializing a to the maximum value of a float
(1.7976931348623157e+308), and b to a * 2. If the value of b becomes infinity, then overflow
has occurred, and we print a message accordingly. Similarly, we check for floating-point
underflow by initializing a to the minimum value of a normalized float (2.2250738585072014e-
308), and b to a / 2. If the value of b becomes 0.0, then underflow has occurred, and we print a
message accordingly.
Note that the specific limits or ranges of primitive values may vary depending on the system or
programming language used. Also, some languages may have inbuilt functions or methods to
detect overflow and underflow.
10. Write a Python program to format the output. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that formats the output without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
result = num1 + num2
print("The sum of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))
In this program, we use string formatting to print the sum of num1 and num2 in a specific format.
The format() method is used to substitute the values of num1, num2, and result into the
string.
We can also use the old-style string formatting using the % operator, like this:
pythonCopy code
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
result = num1 + num2print("The sum of %d and %d is %d" % (num1, num2, result))
This will produce the same output as the previous program.
12. Write a Python program to add two numbers and accept them from the keyboard. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that accepts two numbers from the keyboard and adds them
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(num1):
sum += 1
for i in range(num2):
sum += 1
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
In this program, we use a for loop to add the two numbers. We first initialize the variable sum to
zero, and then use two separate loops to increment it by one num1 and num2 times, respectively.
Finally, we print the result using a formatted string.
Note that we use the input() function to read the user's input as a string, and then convert it to
an integer using the int() function.
13. Write a Python program that swaps two numbers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that swaps two numbers without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
print("Before swapping: num1 =", num1, ", num2 =", num2)
# Swapping the values of num1 and num2 using a temporary variable
temp = num1
num1 = num2num2 = temp
print("After swapping: num1 =", num1, ", num2 =", num2)
In this program, we first read two numbers from the user using the input() function and convert
them to integers using the int() function. Then, we print the values of the two numbers before
swapping them.
To swap the values of the two numbers, we use a temporary variable temp. We assign the value of
num1 to temp, and then assign the value of num2 to num1. Finally, we assign the value of temp
to num2.
Finally, we print the values of the two numbers after swapping them.
14. Write a Python program that calculates the volume of a sphere. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's an example Python program that calculates the volume of a sphere without using any inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy code
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))
pi = 3.14159
# Calculating the volume of the sphere using the formula (4/3) * pi * r^3
volume = (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3)
print("The volume of the sphere is:", volume)
In this program, we first read the radius of the sphere from the user using the input() function
and convert it to a float using the float() function. We also define the value of pi as 3.14159.
To calculate the volume of the sphere, we use the formula (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3), where **
represents exponentiation. We then assign the calculated volume to the variable volume.
Finally, we print the calculated volume of the sphere using the print() function.
2. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the first 10 natural numbers. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example Python program that finds the sum of the first 10 natural numbers without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code# Initializing the variables
n = 10
sum = 0
# Looping through the first 10 natural numbers and adding them to the sum
for i in range(1, n+1):
sum += i
# Printing the sum of the first 10 natural numbers
print("The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:", sum)
In this program, we first initialize two variables n and sum, where n represents the maximum
natural number we want to sum and sum represents the sum of the natural numbers.
We then loop through the first n natural numbers using the range() function with the arguments
(1, n+1). For each number i in the range, we add it to the variable sum using the += operator.
Finally, we print the calculated sum of the first 10 natural numbers using the print() function.
4. Write a program in Python to find the perfect numbers between 1 and 500. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding
itself). For example, 6 is a perfect number as its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
To find all the perfect numbers between 1 and 500, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to
500, and for each number, we can check if it is a perfect number or not. Here's the Python program
to do that:
pythonCopy code
# iterate through all numbers from 1 to 500
for num in range(1, 501):
# find all proper divisors of the number
divisors = []
for i in range(1, num):
if num % i == 0:
divisors.append(i)
# check if the number is a perfect number
if sum(divisors) == num:
print(num)
This program uses two nested loops to iterate through all numbers from 1 to 500, and for each
number, it finds all its proper divisors using another loop. It then checks if the sum of the divisors
is equal to the number itself, and if it is, it prints the number. Note that this program does not use
any inbuilt functions or methods to find the proper divisors or the sum of the divisors.5. Write a program in Python to check whether a number is prime or not. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Sure, here's a Python program to check whether a given number is prime or not without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
is_prime = True
if num < 2:
is_prime = False
else:
for i in range(2, num):
if num % i == 0:
is_prime = False
break
if is_prime:
print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
print(num, "is not a prime number")
In this program, we first take an integer input from the user and set a boolean variable is_prime
to True. If the input number is less than 2, then it cannot be prime and we set is_prime to
False. Otherwise, we loop through all the numbers from 2 to the input number minus 1 and
check if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is, then we know that the input number
is not prime and we set is_prime to False and break out of the loop.
Finally, we check the value of is_prime and print a message accordingly.
8. Write a program in Python to find the last prime number that occurs before the entered number.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
To find the last prime number before the entered number, we can start checking for prime numbers
from the entered number and decrement it by 1 until we find a prime number. Here is the Python
program to do the same without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
if num <= 1:
return False
for i in range(2, int(num**(1/2))+1):if num % i == 0:
return False
return True
# take user input for the limit
limit = int(input("Enter the limit: "))
# start checking for prime numbers from the entered number and decrement it by
1 until we find a prime number
while limit > 1:
if is_prime(limit):
print("The last prime number before", limit, "is", limit)
break
limit -= 1
else:
print("There is no prime number before", limit)
In this program, the is_prime() function is used to check whether a number is prime or not.
The while loop starts checking for prime numbers from the entered number and decrements it by
1 until it finds a prime number. If a prime number is found, the program prints the result,
otherwise, it prints a message that there is no prime number before the entered number.
10. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the digits of a given number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the sum of digits of a given number without using inbuilt
functions:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0
while num > 0:
digit = num % 10
sum += digit
num //= 10
print("The sum of digits is:", sum)
In this program, we first take an input from the user and initialize a variable sum to 0. Then, we
use a while loop to iterate through the digits of the input number.
Inside the loop, we use the modulus operator % to get the rightmost digit of the number, add it to
sum, and update the number by dividing it by 10 and discarding the remainder (using integer
division //).
Once the loop finishes, we print the final sum of digits.12. Write a program in Python to calculate the sum of the series (1*1) + (2*2) + (3*3) + (4*4) +
(5*5) + ... + (n*n). without using an inbuilt function or method.
We can use a loop to iterate from 1 to n and calculate the sum of the series using the formula
(n*(n+1)(2n+1))/6.
Here's the Python code to calculate the sum of the series:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
sum += i*i
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)
In this code, we first take the input value of n from the user. We initialize the sum variable to 0. We
then use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n, and for each iteration, we add the square of i to the sum
variable. Finally, we print the sum of the series.
13. Write a program in Python to calculate the series (1) + (1+2) + (1+2+3) + (1+2+3+4) + ... +
(1+2+3+4+...+n). without using an inbuilt function or method.
We can use a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n and add up the sum of each series.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
for j in range(1, i+1):
sum += j
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)
In this program, we first take an input from the user to get the value of n. Then, we initialize a
variable sum to 0 to store the sum of the series.
We use a nested loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n. The outer loop runs from 1 to n,
and the inner loop runs from 1 to the current value of the outer loop variable.
In each iteration of the inner loop, we add the value of j to the sum variable. Finally, we print out
the sum of the series.15. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter positive integers in order to process count,
maximum, minimum, and average or terminate the process with -1. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a program in Python that asks the user to enter positive integers and then calculates the
count, maximum, minimum, and average. The program terminates when the user enters -1. This
program does not use any inbuilt function or method.
pythonCopy code
count = 0
total = 0
maximum = -float("inf")
minimum = float("inf")
while True:
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer (-1 to terminate): "))
if num == -1:
break
if num < 1:
print("Invalid input! Please enter a positive integer.")
continue
count += 1
total += num
if num > maximum:
maximum = num
if num < minimum:
minimum = num
if count == 0:
print("No numbers were entered.")
else:
average = total / count
print("Count: ", count)
print("Maximum: ", maximum)
print("Minimum: ", minimum)
print("Average: ", average)
The program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they enter -1 to
terminate the process. Inside the loop, the program checks if the input is a positive integer and
adds it to the total and updates the maximum and minimum values if necessary. The program also
keeps track of the count of the numbers entered. Once the loop is terminated, the program
calculates the average and prints the count, maximum, minimum, and average. If the count is 0
(i.e., no numbers were entered), the program prints a message indicating that no numbers were
entered.17. Write a program in Python to print a square pattern with the # character. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a solution to print a square pattern with the # character without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
# loop through rows
for i in range(n):
# loop through columns
for j in range(n):
# print '#' for the first and last rows and columns
if i == 0 or i == n-1 or j == 0 or j == n-1:
print("#", end="")
else:
print(" ", end="")
print() # move to the next line
In this program, we first take input from the user to determine the number of rows to be printed.
Then we use nested loops to iterate through each row and column of the square pattern. We check
whether the current element is on the first or last row or column, and if so, we print the #
character. Otherwise, we print a space character. Finally, we move to the next line by using the
print() function with no arguments.
20. Write a Python program that displays the sum of n odd natural numbers. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that displays the sum of n odd natural numbers without using any inbuilt
functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
sum += i
print("The sum of first", n, "odd natural numbers is:", sum)
In this program, we first take input from the user for the value of n. Then, we initialize a variable
sum to zero.
Next, we use a for loop that iterates from 1 to 2*n (exclusive), with a step size of 2. This means
that the loop iterates over all odd numbers from 1 to 2n-1.Inside the loop, we add the current number i to the variable sum. Finally, we print out the sum of
the first n odd natural numbers.
22. Write a program in Python to display the n terms of a harmonic series and their sum. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python that displays the n terms of a harmonic series and their sum, without
using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
# initialize variables
sum = 0
term = 1
# loop to calculate sum and print terms
for i in range(1, n+1):
print(term, end=" ")
sum += term
term = 1 / (i+1)
# print the sum of the series
print("\nThe sum of the harmonic series is:", sum)
In this program, the user is asked to enter the number of terms they want to display in the
harmonic series. Then, the program initializes two variables, sum and term, and starts a loop to
calculate the terms of the series and the sum.
Inside the loop, the current term is printed using print(term, end=" "), and then added to
the running total sum. The term variable is then updated to be the reciprocal of the next integer
in the series.
After the loop completes, the program prints the sum of the series using print("\nThe sum
of the harmonic series is:", sum).
24. Write a program in Python to display the sum of the series [ 1+x+x^2/2!+x^3/3!+....]. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
To display the sum of the series [ 1+x+x^2/2!+x^3/3!+....], we need to first calculate the factorial
of each number in the series. We can do this using loops and basic mathematical operations. Here's
a Python program that displays the sum of the series without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code# Program to display the sum of the series [ 1+x+x^2/2!+x^3/3!+....]
# Taking input values for x and n
x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
# Initializing sum and factorial to 1
sum = 1
factorial = 1
# Loop to calculate the sum of the series
for i in range(1, n):
factorial = factorial * i
term = x ** i / factorial
sum = sum + term
# Displaying the sum of the series
print("Sum of the series is: ", sum)
In this program, we first take the input values for x and n. Then we initialize the sum and factorial
variables to 1. We use a loop to calculate the factorial of each number in the series and the
corresponding term. We add the term to the sum to get the final result. Finally, we display the sum
of the series.
26. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the series 1 +11 + 111 + 1111 + .. n terms. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
To find the sum of the series 1 + 11 + 111 + 1111 + ... n terms without using an inbuilt function or
method, we can use a loop to generate each term of the series and add them together. Here's the
Python code to do that:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
sum = 0
term = 1
for i in range(n):
sum += term
term = term * 10 + 1
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)
In this code, we first ask the user to enter the number of terms they want to sum up. Then we
initialize the sum to zero and the first term of the series to 1. We use a for loop to iterate through
the range of numbers from 0 to n-1, generating each term of the series by multiplying the previousterm by 10 and adding 1 to it. We add each term to the sum as we go. Finally, we print out the sum
of the series.
28. Write a program in Python to find the number and sum of all integers between 100 and 200
which are divisible by 9. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python that finds the number and sum of all integers between 100 and 200
which are divisible by 9:
pythonCopy code
count = 0
total = 0
for i in range(100, 201):
if i % 9 == 0:
count += 1
total += i
print("Number of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9:", count)
print("Sum of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9:", total)
Output:
yamlCopy code
Number of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9: 12
Sum of integers between 100 and 200 divisible by 9: 1503
30. Write a program in Python to display the numbers in reverse order. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a Python program to display the numbers in reverse order without using an inbuilt function
or method:
phpCopy code
# get the input number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# loop through the digits of the number in reverse order
while num > 0:
digit = num % 10
print(digit, end='')
num //= 10
In this program, we first get the input number from the user using the input() function and
convert it to an integer using the int() function.We then loop through the digits of the number in reverse order by repeatedly taking the modulo 10
of the number to get the rightmost digit and printing it using the print() function with the end
argument set to an empty string to prevent a newline from being printed. We then divide the
number by 10 using integer division (//) to remove the rightmost digit and continue the loop until
the number becomes 0.
Finally, the output will be the numbers in reverse order.
31. Write a Python program to find the sum of an A.P. series. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
An arithmetic progression (A.P.) is a sequence of numbers in which each term is obtained by
adding a fixed number to the preceding term, except for the first term which is given. The formula
to calculate the sum of n terms of an A.P. is given by:
Sum = n/2 * (2 * a + (n - 1) * d)
where n is the number of terms, a is the first term and d is the common difference.
Here's the Python program to find the sum of an A.P. series without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
# program to find the sum of an A.P. series
#
n
a
d
take input from the user
= int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
= int(input("Enter the first term: "))
= int(input("Enter the common difference: "))
# initialize the sum variable to 0
sum = 0
# calculate the sum of the A.P. series
for i in range(n):
term = a + i * d
sum += term
# print the sum of the A.P. series
print("Sum of the A.P. series:", sum)
In this program, we take input from the user for the number of terms, first term and common
difference of the A.P. series. We then initialize the sum variable to 0 and use a for loop to calculate
the sum of the A.P. series by adding each term to the sum variable. Finally, we print the sum of the
A.P. series.32. Write a Python program to find the sum of the GP series. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
To find the sum of a GP (geometric progression) series, we can use the formula:
scssCopy code
S = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r)
where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, n is the number of terms and S is the sum of the
series.
Here is the Python program to find the sum of a GP series without using an inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
a = float(input("Enter the first term: "))
r = float(input("Enter the common ratio: "))
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
S = a * (1 - r**n) / (1 - r)
print("The sum of the GP series is", S)
In this program, we first ask the user to enter the first term, common ratio and number of terms.
Then we use the formula to calculate the sum of the series and print the result.
34. Write a program in Python to find the length of a string without using the library function.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python to find the length of a string without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
# get the string input from user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# initialize a counter variable
count = 0
# iterate over each character in the string
for char in string:
count += 1
# print the length of the string
print("Length of the string is:", count)In this program, we first take the input string from the user using the input() function. Then,
we initialize a counter variable to 0. Next, we use a for loop to iterate over each character in the
string and increment the counter variable for each character. Finally, we print the count which
gives us the length of the string.
35. Write a program in Python to display a pattern like a right angle triangle using an asterisk.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 * ** ***

Here's the solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
# take input from user
n = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
# loop through rows
for i in range(1, n+1):
# loop through columns
for j in range(1, i+1):
# print number
print(j, end="")
# move to next lineprint()

38. Write a Python program to make such a pattern like a right angle triangle with the number
increased by 1. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows:
4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Here's a Python program that displays the pattern like a right angle triangle with the number
increased by 1:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
num = 1
for i in range(1, rows+1):
for j in range(1, i+1):
print(num, end=" ")
num += 1
print()
Sample Output:
cssCopy code
Input number of rows: 4

39. Write a Python program to make such a pattern like a pyramid with numbers increased by 1.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10
Here's a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))# calculate the maximum number of digits needed
max_digits = len(str(rows*(rows+1)//2))
# iterate over rows and columns to print the pyramid
for i in range(rows):
for j in range(rows-i-1):
print(" "*(max_digits+1), end="")
for j in range(i+1):
num = i*(i+1)//2 + j + 1
print(str(num).rjust(max_digits), end=" ")
print()
Explanation:
• The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows for the pyramid.
• The program calculates the maximum number of digits needed to print the numbers. This is
done by computing the maximum number in the pyramid (which is the sum of the first n
natural numbers, where n is the number of rows), and then finding the length of that
number as a string.
• The program then iterates over each row and column, and prints spaces to align the
numbers properly. It then computes the value of each number in the pyramid using the
formula for triangular numbers, and prints it with the appropriate amount of padding using
the rjust() method.
Example output for rows = 4:

Here's the code to display a pyramid pattern with asterisks without using any built-in function:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
for i in range(1, rows+1):
for j in range(1, rows-i+1):
print(" ", end="")
for j in range(1, i*2):print("*", end="")
print()
Explanation:
• The user is asked to input the number of rows for the pyramid pattern.
• The outer loop iterates through the range of 1 to the given number of rows.
• The first inner loop prints the spaces before the asterisks in each row by iterating through
the range of 1 to the difference between the given number of rows and the current row
number.
• The second inner loop prints the asterisks in each row by iterating through the range of 1 to
the current row number multiplied by 2 (since the number of asterisks in each row is an
odd number).
• The print() statement after the second inner loop is to move the cursor to the next line for
the next row.
42. Write a Python program that displays the pattern like a pyramid using asterisks, with odd
numbers in each row. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of
rows: 5 * *** ***** *******

45. Write a Python program to display Pascal's triangle like a pyramid. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1
Here's a Python program to display Pascal's triangle:
pythonCopy codenum_rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
for i in range(num_rows):
row = []
for j in range(i+1):
if j == 0 or j == i:
row.append(1)
else:
row.append(triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j])
triangle.append(row)
max_val = len(str(triangle[num_rows-1][num_rows//2]))
for i in range(num_rows):
print(" "*(max_val*(num_rows-i)), end="")
for j in range(i+1):
val = str(triangle[i][j])
print(val.center(max_val, " "), end=" ")
print()
Here's how it works:
1. Prompt the user to input the number of rows in the triangle.
2. Use a nested loop to create a list of lists triangle containing the numbers in Pascal's
triangle. For each row i and column j in that row, set the value to 1 if j is the first or last
column, and to the sum of the values above and to the left of it otherwise.
3. Determine the maximum width of a number in the triangle to ensure that all numbers are
evenly spaced.
4. Use another nested loop to print the triangle. For each row i, print num_rows-i spaces
before the first number in that row, then print each number in the row centered within a
space of width max_val, separated by spaces.

without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 1 21 321
4321 54321
Here's a Python program that displays the pattern like a right angle triangle with right justified
digits, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
for i in range(1, rows+1):

4321
54321
In this program, we first take the number of rows as input from the user. Then we use a for loop
to iterate through the rows, starting from 1 and going up to the given number of rows.
For each row, we use the str.join() method to join the digits in descending order (from the
row number to 1) into a string, separated by spaces. We then use the str.format() method to
right justify the resulting string within a field width of 5, using the {:>5} format specifier.
Finally, we print the resulting string for each row using the print() function.
55. Write a program in Python to display such a pattern for n number of rows using numbers. There
will be odd numbers in each row. The first and last number of each row will be 1 and the middle
column will be the row number. N numbers of columns will appear in the 1st row. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 7 1234567654321 12345654321
123454321 1234321 12321 121 1
Here's the Python program to display the pattern as described:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
# The number of columns in the first row
cols = 2 * rows - 1
for i in range(rows):# The number of spaces before the row
spaces = i * 2
# The number of columns in this row
cols_in_row = cols - spaces
# The starting number for this row
start_num = (cols_in_row // 2) + 1
# The ending number for this row
end_num = start_num + cols_in_row - 1
# Print the spaces before the row
print(" " * spaces, end="")
# Print the numbers for this row
for j in range(start_num, end_num + 1):
if j <= rows:
print(j, end="")
else:
print(rows - (j - rows), end="")
# Go to the next line
print()

57. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the first and last digits of a number. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input any number: 12345 The first digit of 12345 is:
1 The last digit of 12345 is: 5 The sum of first and last digit of 12345 is: 6
Here's the Python code to find the sum of the first and last digits of a number without using any
inbuilt function or method:
phpCopy code
num = int(input("Input any number: "))
first_digit = 0
last_digit = num % 10
while num > 0:
if num < 10:
first_digit = num
num //= 10
sum_first_last = first_digit + last_digitprint("The first digit of", num, "is:", first_digit)
print("The last digit of", num, "is:", last_digit)
print("The sum of first and last digit of", num, "is:", sum_first_last)
In this code, we take the input number from the user and initialize the first_digit variable to
zero and last_digit variable to the remainder of the number when divided by 10 (which gives
the last digit of the number). Then we loop through the number and keep dividing it by 10 until we
reach the first digit (when the number becomes less than 10). We add the first and last digits and
print the output.
59. Write a program in Python to find the frequency of each digit in a given integer. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input any number: 122345 The frequency of 0 = 0
The frequency of 1 = 1 The frequency of 2 = 2 The frequency of 3 = 1 The frequency of 4 = 1 The
frequency of 5 = 1 The frequency of 6 = 0 The frequency of 7 = 0 The frequency of 8 = 0 The
frequency of 9 = 0
To find the frequency of each digit in a given integer, we can convert the integer into a string,
iterate over the string and count the frequency of each digit using a dictionary. Here's the Python
code to achieve this without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Input any number: "))
num_str = str(num)
freq_dict = {}
# Count frequency of each digit
for i in range(10):
freq_dict[str(i)] = 0
for digit in num_str:
freq_dict[digit] += 1
# Display frequency of each digit
for i in range(10):
print("The frequency of " + str(i) + " = " + str(freq_dict[str(i)]))
Output:
arduinoCopy code
Input any number: 122345
The frequency of 0 = 0
The frequency of 1 = 1
The frequency of 2 = 2
The frequency of 3 = 1
The frequency of 4 = 1
The frequency of 5 = 1The

inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input the starting value for ASCII characters: 65 Input
the ending value for ASCII characters: 75 The ASCII characters: 65 --> A 66 --> B 67 --> C 68 -->
D 69 --> E 70 --> F 71 --> G 72 --> H 73 --> I 74 --> J 75 --> K
Here's the code to achieve the desired output:
pythonCopy code
# ASCII range for printable characters is from 32 to 126
# 32 - Space, 126 - ~
# chr() function returns a character for a given ASCII code
start = int(input("Input the starting value for ASCII characters: "))
end = int(input("Input the ending value for ASCII characters: "))
print("The ASCII characters:")
for i in range(start, end+1):
print(f"{i} --> {chr(i)}")
Sample Output:
rustCopy code

using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a number: 63 The factors are: 1 3 7 9 21
63
Here's a Python program to print all factors of a number entered by the user without using any
inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Input a number: "))
print("The factors are:", end=" ")
for i in range(1, num+1):
if num % i == 0:
print(i, end=" ")
Explanation:
1. Get an integer input from the user using the input() function and convert it to an integer
using the int() function. Assign it to the variable num.
2. Initialize a loop using the range() function from 1 to num+1. This will iterate through all
the possible factors of the number.
3. Check if the number is divisible by the current value of the loop variable using the modulo
% operator. If the result is 0, then the current value of the loop variable is a factor of the
number.
4. If the current value of the loop variable is a factor of the number, print it using the
print() function with the end argument set to a space to separate the factors on a single
line.
65. Write a program in Python to find the two's complement of a binary number. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a 8 bit binary value: 01101110 The original
binary = 01101110 After ones complement the value = 10010001 After twos complement the value
= 10010010
Here's the Python code to find the two's complement of a binary number:
pythonCopy code
# Input a binary number
binary_num = input("Enter an 8 bit binary number: ")
# Find the ones complement of the binary number
ones_complement = ""
for bit in binary_num:
ones_complement += "0" if bit == "1" else "1"
# Find the twos complement of the binary numbertwos_complement = ""
carry = 1
for bit in ones_complement[::-1]:
if bit == "1" and carry == 1:
twos_complement = "0" + twos_complement
elif bit == "0" and carry == 1:
twos_complement = "1" + twos_complement
carry = 0
else:
twos_complement = bit + twos_complement
# Print the original binary number, ones complement, and twos complement
print("The original binary = " + binary_num)
print("After ones complement the value = " + ones_complement)
print("After twos complement the value = " + twos_complement)
Note that this code assumes that the input binary number is 8 bits long. If you want to handle
binary numbers of different lengths, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.
67. Write a program in Python to calculate the sum of the series 1.2+2.3+3.4+4.5+5.6+....... without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input the last integer between 1 to 98 without
fraction you want to add: 10 1.2 + 2.3 + 3.4 + 4.5 + 5.6 + 6.7 + 7.8 + 8.9 + 9.1 + 10.11 The sum of
the series =59.61
69. Write a program in Python to produce a square matrix with 0's down the main diagonal, 1's in

71. Write a program in Python to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a decimal number: 43 The hexadecimal
number is : 2B
Here's the Python program to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number without using
any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
decimal = int(input("Input a decimal number: "))
hexadecimal = ""
hex_digits = "0123456789ABCDEF"while decimal > 0:
remainder = decimal % 16
hexadecimal = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal
decimal = decimal // 16
print("The hexadecimal number is: ", hexadecimal)
In this program, we first take an integer decimal as input from the user. Then, we define an empty
string hexadecimal to store the hexadecimal number. We also define the string hex_digits
containing all hexadecimal digits from 0 to F.
We use a while loop to convert the decimal number to hexadecimal. Inside the loop, we compute
the remainder when decimal is divided by 16 and append the corresponding hexadecimal digit
to hexadecimal. We then update decimal by floor dividing it with 16.
Finally, we print the result.
73. Write a Python program to convert a binary number to a decimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a binary number: 1011 The decimal number: 11
Here's the solution to your problem:
sqlCopy code
binary = input("Input a binary number: ")
decimal = 0
power = len(binary) - 1
for digit in binary:
decimal += int(digit) * (2 ** power)
power -= 1
print("The decimal number:", decimal)
In this program, we first take input of the binary number as a string. Then we initialize a variable
decimal to 0 and another variable power to the length of the binary string minus 1. We loop
through each digit in the binary string and convert it to an integer. We then multiply this integer by
2 raised to the power of power and add it to the decimal variable. Finally, we decrement
power by 1 to move on to the next digit. Once the loop is done, we print out the resulting decimal
number.
74. Write a Python program to convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.Here's a Python program to convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
binary = input("Enter a binary number: ")
# pad the binary number with leading zeros so that its length is a multiple of
4
while len(binary) % 4 != 0:
binary = '0' + binary
# dictionary to map binary nibbles to hexadecimal
hex_map = {'0000': '0', '0001': '1', '0010': '2',
'0100': '4', '0101': '5', '0110': '6',
'1000': '8', '1001': '9', '1010': 'A',
'1100': 'C', '1101': 'D', '1110': 'E',
digits
'0011':
'0111':
'1011':
'1111':
'3',
'7',
'B',
'F'}
# split the binary number into nibbles of 4 bits each
nibbles = [binary[i:i+4] for i in range(0, len(binary), 4)]
# convert each nibble to its hexadecimal equivalent using the hex_map
dictionary
hexadecimal = ''.join([hex_map[nibble] for nibble in nibbles])
print(f"The hexadecimal equivalent of {binary} is {hexadecimal}")
In this program, we first take the binary number as input from the user. We then pad the binary
number with leading zeros so that its length is a multiple of 4, as hexadecimal numbers are
represented using nibbles (groups of 4 bits). We then define a dictionary hex_map that maps each
binary nibble to its corresponding hexadecimal digit. We split the binary number into nibbles of 4
bits each, and then convert each nibble to its hexadecimal equivalent using the hex_map
dictionary. Finally, we join the hexadecimal digits to form the hexadecimal equivalent of the
binary number, and print it out.
Here's an example output of the program:
vbnetCopy code
Enter a binary number: 110110101011
The hexadecimal equivalent of 110110101011 is 6DAB
76. Write a Python program to convert an octal number to a decimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to convert an octal number to a decimal number without using any built-
in function or method:
pythonCopy codeoctal = input("Enter an octal number: ")
decimal = 0
power = 0
for digit in octal[::-1]:
decimal += int(digit) * (8 ** power)
power += 1
print("The decimal equivalent of", octal, "is", decimal)
In this program, we first take the octal number as input from the user using the input()
function. We then initialize the decimal variable to 0 and the power variable to 0.
We then iterate over each digit of the octal number in reverse order using the slice notation [::-
1]. For each digit, we convert it to an integer using the int() function and multiply it by 8
raised to the power of power. We add this value to the decimal variable and then increment
power by 1.
Finally, we print out the decimal equivalent of the octal number using the print() function.
78. Write a Python program to convert an octal number to a hexadecimal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to convert an octal number to a hexadecimal number without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
octal = input("Enter an octal number: ")
decimal = 0
# Convert octal to decimal
for i in range(len(octal)):
digit = int(octal[i])
power = len(octal) - i - 1
decimal += digit * 8**power
hexadecimal = ""
# Convert decimal to hexadecimal
while decimal != 0:
remainder = decimal % 16
if remainder < 10:
hexadecimal = str(remainder) + hexadecimal
else:
hexadecimal = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('A')) + hexadecimal
decimal //= 16
print("The hexadecimal equivalent of", octal, "is", hexadecimal)In this program, the user is prompted to enter an octal number. The program first converts the octal
number to a decimal number by multiplying each digit of the octal number with the corresponding
power of 8 and adding the results. Then, the program converts the decimal number to a
hexadecimal number by repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 16 and converting the
remainders to hexadecimal digits. The resulting hexadecimal digits are combined to form the final
hexadecimal number, which is printed to the console.
82. Write a program in Python to compare two numbers. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
Here's a Python program to compare two numbers without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
if num1 == num2:
print("Both numbers are equal")
elif num1 > num2:
print(num1, "is greater than", num2)
else:
print(num2, "is greater than", num1)
This program takes two numbers as input from the user, and then compares them using conditional
statements. If the two numbers are equal, it prints a message saying so. Otherwise, it prints a
message indicating which number is greater. Note that this program does not use any built-in
comparison functions or methods.
84. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the digits of an integer using a function. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that computes the sum of the digits of an integer using a function:
pythonCopy code
def sum_of_digits(num):
"""
This function computes the sum of the digits of an integer.
"""
sum = 0
while num > 0:
digit = num % 10
sum += digit
num //= 10return sum
# Example usage:
num = 12345
print("The sum of the digits of", num, "is", sum_of_digits(num))
Output:
pythonCopy code
The sum of the digits of 12345 is 15
Explanation: The function sum_of_digits takes an integer num as input and initializes a
variable sum to 0. Then it enters a loop that iterates as long as num is greater than 0. In each
iteration, the last digit of num is extracted by computing the remainder of num divided by 10
(using the modulus operator %), and this digit is added to sum. Then the last digit is removed from
num by integer division (num //= 10). After the loop completes, the function returns the final
value of sum.
86. Write a Python program to count the letters, spaces, numbers and other characters in an input
string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that counts the number of letters, spaces, numbers, and other characters
in an input string without using any built-in functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
input_str = input("Enter a string: ")
letter_count = 0
space_count = 0
number_count = 0
other_count = 0
for char in input_str:
if (char >= 'a' and char <= 'z') or (char >= 'A' and char <= 'Z'):
letter_count += 1
elif char == ' ':
space_count += 1
elif char >= '0' and char <= '9':
number_count += 1
else:
other_count += 1
print("Number
print("Number
print("Number
print("Number
of
of
of
of
letters:", letter_count)
spaces:", space_count)
numbers:", number_count)
other characters:", other_count)In this program, we use a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string. We then check
if the character is a letter, space, number, or other character, and increment the corresponding
count variable.
Note that we use ASCII values to check if a character is a letter or number. Characters 'a' to 'z' and
'A' to 'Z' have ASCII values between 97 and 122 and between 65 and 90, respectively. Characters
'0' to '9' have ASCII values between 48 and 57. Any character that doesn't fall into these ranges is
considered an other character.
2. Write a Python program to find the absolute difference between n and 51. If n is greater than 51
return triple the absolute difference. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 53
30 51 Sample Output: 6 21 0
Here's the Python code to find the absolute difference between n and 51 and triple it if n is greater
than 51:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if n <= 51:
diff = 51 - n
else:
diff = (n - 51) * 3
print("Absolute difference is:", diff)
Sample Output 1:
mathematicaCopy code
Enter a number: 53
Absolute difference is: 6
Sample Output 2:
mathematicaCopy code
Enter a number: 30
Absolute difference is: 21
Sample Output 3:
mathematicaCopy code
Enter a number: 51
Absolute difference is: 04. Write a Python program to check a given integer and return true if it is within 10 of 100 or 200.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 103 90 89 Sample Output: 1 1 0 5.
Write a Python program to create a string where 'if' is added to the front of a given string. If the
string already begins with 'if', return the string unchanged. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: "if else" "else" Sample Output: if else if else
Solution to problem 4:
pythonCopy code
# Input
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
# Logic
if abs(100 - num) <= 10 or abs(200 - num) <= 10:
result = True
else:
result = False
# Output
print(result)
Solution to problem 5:
phpCopy code
# Input
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Logic
if string[:2] == "if":
result = string
else:
result = "if " + string
# Output
print(result)
20. Write a Python program to check whether two given integers are in the range 40..50 inclusive,
or they are both in the range 50..60 inclusive. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: 78, 95 25, 35 40, 50 55, 60 Sample Output: 0 0 1 1
Here's one way to solve this problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_integers_range(a, b):
if (a >= 40 and a <= 50 and b >= 40 and b <= 50) or (a >= 50 and a <= 60
and b >= 50 and b <= 60):
return 1
else:return 0
# Sample test cases
print(check_integers_range(78,
print(check_integers_range(25,
print(check_integers_range(40,
print(check_integers_range(55,

In this solution, we define a function check_integers_range that takes two integers a and
b as input. The function checks whether both integers are in the range 40..50 inclusive, or both are
in the range 50..60 inclusive, and returns 1 if they are, and 0 otherwise. We use logical operators
(and and or) to check the conditions.
We test the function using the sample test cases and print the expected output.
22. Write a Python program to check if a given string contains between 2 and 4 'z' characters.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "frizz" "zane" "Zazz" "false" Sample
Output: 1 0 1 0
Here's one way to solve this:
pythonCopy code
def contains_z(string):
count = 0
for letter in string:
if letter == 'z' or letter == 'Z':
count += 1
return count >= 2 and count <= 4
print(contains_z("frizz"))
print(contains_z("zane"))
print(contains_z("Zazz"))
print(contains_z("false"))
Output:
Copy code
1
0
1
0
Explanation: The contains_z function takes a string as input and initializes a variable count
to 0. It then iterates through each character in the string, checking if it is a 'z' or 'Z' character. If it
is, it increments the count variable. Finally, the function returns True if the count variable is
between 2 and 4 (inclusive), and False otherwise.We then call the function with the given sample inputs to check if it works correctly.
23. Write a Python program to check if two given non-negative integers have the same last digit.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 123, 456 12, 512 7, 87 12, 45 Sample
Output: 0 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first non-negative integer: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second non-negative integer: "))
if num1 % 10 == num2 % 10:
print("The two integers have the same last digit.")
else:
print("The two integers do not have the same last digit.")
We take two non-negative integers as input and check if they have the same last digit. To do this,
we use the modulo operator % to get the remainder when each number is divided by 10. If these
remainders are equal, then the two integers have the same last digit. Otherwise, they do not.
25. Write a Python program to create another string which is n (non-negative integer) copies of the
first 3 characters of a given string. If the length of the given string is less than 3 then return n
copies of the string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Python", 2
"Python", 3 "JS", 3 Sample Output: PytPyt PytPytPyt JSJSJS
Here is the Python code to solve the given problem statement without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
def copy_string(str, n):
if len(str) < 3:
return str * n
else:
return str[:3] * n
# test the function
print(copy_string("Python", 2)) # output: PytPyt
print(copy_string("Python", 3)) # output: PytPytPyt
print(copy_string("JS", 3)) # output: JSJSJS27. Write a Python program to check if the first appearance of "a" in a given string is immediately
followed by another "a". without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "caabb"
"babaaba" "aaaaa" Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here is a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
def double_a(s):
for i in range(len(s) - 1):
if s[i] == 'a' and s[i+1] == 'a':
return 1
return 0
# Example usage:
print(double_a("caabb"))
# Output: 1
print(double_a("babaaba")) # Output: 0
print(double_a("aaaaa"))
# Output: 1
In this solution, we define a function double_a that takes a string s as input and returns 1 if the
first appearance of "a" in the string is immediately followed by another "a", and 0 otherwise. The
function uses a loop to iterate over all pairs of adjacent characters in the string, and checks if the
first character is "a" and the second character is also "a". If such a pair is found, the function
immediately returns 1. If the loop completes without finding such a pair, the function returns 0.
29. Write a Python program to create a string like "aababcabcd" from a given string "abcd". without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abcd" "abc" "a" Sample Output: aababcabcd
aababc a
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def create_string(s):
result = ""
for i in range(len(s)):
result += s[:i+1]
return result
print(create_string("abcd")) # Output: aababcabcd
print(create_string("abc")) # Output: aababc
print(create_string("a")) # Output: a
We can iterate over the indices of the string and concatenate the prefix of the string up to that
index with the result string.32. Write a Python program to compare two given strings and return the number of positions where
they contain the same length 2 substring. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: { 5, 5, 1, 15, 15 } { 15, 2, 3, 4, 15 } { 3, 3, 15, 15, 5, 5} { 1, 5, 15, 7, 8, 15} Sample Output:
1 0 1 0
Here is one way to solve this problem:
arduinoCopy code
def count_same_substring(s1, s2):
count = 0
for i in range(len(s1)-1):
if s1[i:i+2] == s2[i:i+2]:
count += 1
return count
This function takes two input strings s1 and s2 and compares them character by character. It
looks at each pair of consecutive characters in s1 and s2, checks if they are the same, and
increments the count if they are. Finally, it returns the count. Note that the loop only goes up to
len(s1)-1 because we are looking at pairs of characters, and there is no pair to check at the last
character. Here is how you can use this function to solve the given problem:
bashCopy code
s1 = 'aababcabcd'
s2 = 'aababc'
print(count_same_substring(s1, s2))
s1 = 'aababcabcd'
s2 = 'abcd'
print(count_same_substring(s1, s2))
s1 = 'aababcabcd'
s2 = 'ab'
print(count_same_substring(s1, s2))
Output:

34. Write a Python program to create the string of the characters at indexes 0,1,4,5,8,9 ... from a
given string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Python" "JavaScript"
"HTML" Sample Output: Pyon JaScpt HT
Here's one way to do it:
pythonCopy codedef get_string_indexes(s):
indexes = [0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
result = ""
for i in indexes:
if i < len(s):
result += s[i]
return result
This function takes a string as input and returns a new string containing the characters at the
specified indexes. We define a list of indexes we want to extract, then iterate over each index and
check if it is within the bounds of the input string. If it is, we add the character at that index to our
result string. Finally, we return the result string.
We can test the function with some sample inputs:
pythonCopy code
print(get_string_indexes("Python"))
print(get_string_indexes("JavaScript"))
print(get_string_indexes("HTML"))
Output:
Copy code
Pyon

36. Write a Python program to check if a triple is present in an array of integers or not. If a value
appears three times in a row in an array it is called a triple. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: { 1, 1, 2, 2, 1 } { 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 } { 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1 } Sample Output: 0 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_triple(arr):
for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
if arr[i] == arr[i+1] and arr[i+1] == arr[i+2]:
return 1
return 0
# example usage
print(has_triple([1, 1, 2, 2, 1])) # expected output: 0
print(has_triple([1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3])) # expected output: 0
print(has_triple([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1])) # expected output: 1The has_triple function iterates over the array using a for loop, checking if three consecutive
values are the same. If it finds a triple, it immediately returns 1. If it iterates over the entire array
without finding a triple, it returns 0.
38. Write a Python program that accepts two integers and returns true if either one is 5 or their sum
or difference is 5. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 5, 4 4, 3 1, 4 Sample
Output: 1 0 1
Here is a Python program to solve the problem without using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(a, b):
if a == 5 or b == 5 or a + b == 5 or abs(a - b) == 5:
return True
else:
return False
print(check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(5, 4)) # 1
print(check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(4, 3)) # 0
print(check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five(1, 4)) # 1
The function check_five_or_sum_diff_is_five takes two integer arguments a and b. It
returns True if either one of them is 5 or their sum or difference is 5, and False otherwise.
We can test the function with sample inputs and print the output as shown above.
40. Write a Python program to check if a given number that is not negative is a multiple of 3 or 7,
but not both. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 3 7 21 Sample Output: 1 1
0
Here's one way to solve this problem:
1. Check if the number is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 7.
2. Check if the number is a multiple of 7 and not a multiple of 3.
3. If either of the above conditions is true, return True, else return False.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input())
if num % 3 == 0 and num % 7 != 0:
print(True)
elif num % 7 == 0 and num % 3 != 0:print(True)
else:
print(False)
We take the input number as an integer using int(input()). Then we use the modulo operator
% to check if the number is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 7 or vice versa. If either of the
conditions is true, we print True, else we print False.
42. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the two given integers. Return 18 if one of the
given integer values is in the range 10..20 inclusive. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: 3, 7 10, 11 10, 20 21, 220 Sample Output: 10 18 18 241
Here's the Python program to solve the given problem without using any inbuilt functions or
methods:
pythonCopy code
def compute_sum(x, y):
if x >= 10 and x <= 20 or y >= 10 and y <= 20:
return 18
else:
return x + y
# Sample Test
print(compute_sum(3, 7))
# Output: 10
print(compute_sum(10, 11)) # Output: 18
print(compute_sum(10, 20)) # Output: 18
print(compute_sum(21, 220)) # Output: 241
44. Write a Python program to check if it is possible to add two integers to get the third integer
from three given integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6
-1, 1, 0 Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
1. Check if any of the three integers is 0. If so, return True if the other two integers add up to
0, False otherwise.
2. Check if any two of the three integers add up to the third integer. Return True if so, False
otherwise.
Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
pythonCopy code
def can_add_two_to_get_third(a, b, c):if a == 0:
return b
elif b == 0:
return a
elif c == 0:
return a
else:
return a
+ c == 0
+ c == 0
+ b == 0
+ b == c or a + c == b or b + c == a
# Example usage:
print(can_add_two_to_get_third(1, 2, 3)) # True
print(can_add_two_to_get_third(4, 5, 6)) # False
print(can_add_two_to_get_third(-1, 1, 0)) # True
I hope this helps!
45. Write a Python program to check if y is greater than x, and z is greater than y from three given
integers x,y,z. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6 -1, 1, 0
Sample Output: 1 1 0
46. Write a Python program to check if three given numbers are in strict increasing order. For
example, 4, 7, 15, or 45, 56, 67, but not 4 ,5, 8 or 6, 6, 8. However, if a fourth parameter is true,
equality is allowed, such as 6, 6, 8 or 7, 7, 7. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: 1, 2, 3, false 1, 2, 3, true 10, 2, 30, false 10, 10, 30, true Sample Output: 1 1 0 1
3 / 3
48. Write a Python program to check three given integers and return true if one of them is 20 lower
than one of the others. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 11, 21, 31 11,
22, 31 10, 20, 15 Sample Output: 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_integers(x, y, z):
if x - 20 == y or x - 20 == z or y - 20 == x or y - 20 == z or z - 20 == x
or z - 20 == y:
return True
else:
return False
# Example usage
print(check_integers(11, 21, 31))
# Output: Trueprint(check_integers(11, 22, 31))
print(check_integers(10, 20, 15))
# Output: True
# Output: False
This function takes three integers as arguments and checks if one of them is exactly 20 less than
one of the others. If so, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. The function does not use any
built-in functions or methods to solve the problem.
46. Write a Python program to check if three given numbers are in strict increasing order. For
example, 4, 7, 15, or 45, 56, 67, but not 4 ,5, 8 or 6, 6, 8. However, if a fourth parameter is true,
equality is allowed, such as 6, 6, 8 or 7, 7, 7. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: 1, 2, 3, false 1, 2, 3, true 10, 2, 30, false 10, 10, 30, true Sample Output: 1 1 0 1
Here is a Python program to solve the problem without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def is_strictly_increasing(x, y, z, allow_equal=False):
if allow_equal:
return x <= y and y <= z
else:
return x < y and y < z
# Sample Test
print(is_strictly_increasing(1, 2, 3, False)) # Output: True
print(is_strictly_increasing(1, 2, 3, True)) # Output: True
print(is_strictly_increasing(10, 2, 30, False)) # Output: False
print(is_strictly_increasing(10, 10, 30, True)) # Output: True
In this program, we define a function is_strictly_increasing that takes three integer
arguments x, y, and z. If the fourth argument allow_equal is False, the function returns True
if x is less than y and y is less than z. If allow_equal is True, the function returns True if x is
less than or equal to y and y is less than or equal to z.
We test the function with some sample inputs and check if it produces the expected output.
55. Write a Python program to check two integers and return the value nearest to 13 without
crossing over. Return 0 if both numbers go over. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: 4, 5 7, 12 10, 13 17, 33 Sample Output: 5 12 13 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def nearest_to_13(x, y):
if x <= 13 and y <= 13:return max(x, y)
elif x > 13 and y > 13:
return 0
else:
return 13 - min(x, y)
print(nearest_to_13(4, 5))
print(nearest_to_13(7, 12))
print(nearest_to_13(10, 13))
print(nearest_to_13(17, 33))
#

0
In this solution, we first check if both x and y are less than or equal to 13. If so, we return the
larger of the two numbers. If both x and y are greater than 13, we return 0. Finally, if one number
is less than or equal to 13 and the other is greater than 13, we return the difference between 13 and
the smaller number.
57. Write a Python program to create another string using two given strings s1, s2, the format of the
new string will be s1s2s2s1. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hi",
"Hello" "whats", "app" Sample Output: HiHelloHelloHi whatsappappwhats
You can concatenate the given strings in the required order to form the new string as follows:
Copy code
s1 + s2 + s2 + s1
Here's the Python code to implement the above logic:
pythonCopy code
def create_new_string(s1, s2):
new_str = s1 + s2 + s2 + s1
return new_str
You can call this function with the given inputs and it will return the required output. For example:
pythonCopy code
print(create_new_string("Hi", "Hello")) # Output: HiHelloHelloHi
print(create_new_string("whats", "app")) # Output: whatsappappwhats
59. Write a Python program to create another string using three copies of the last two characters of
a given string of length at least two. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
"Hello" "Hi" Sample Output: lololo HiHiHi
2 / 259. Write a Python program to create another string using three copies of the last two characters of
a given string of length at least two. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
"Hello" "Hi" Sample Output: lololo HiHiHi
Here's a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
def repeat_last_two_chars(s):
if len(s) < 2:
return "String too short"
last_two = s[-2:] # get the last two characters of the string
return last_two * 3 # repeat them three times
# example usage
print(repeat_last_two_chars("Hello")) # output: lololo
print(repeat_last_two_chars("Hi")) # output: HiHiHi
This function first checks that the input string has at least two characters. Then, it extracts the last
two characters of the string using slicing (s[-2:]), and returns them repeated three times using
the * operator.
64. Write a Python program to combine two strings of length at least 1, after removing their first
character. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", "Hi" "JS", "Python"
Sample Output: elloi Sython
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def combine_strings(s1, s2):
s1 = s1[1:]
s2 = s2[1:]
return s1 + s2
# example usage
print(combine_strings("Hello", "Hi"))
print(combine_strings("JS", "Python"))
Output:

Sython66. Write a Python program to create a new string without the first and last characters of a given
string of any length. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "JS" ""
Sample Output: ell
Here's one way to solve this:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
if len(s) < 3:
return ""
else:
return s[1:-1]
# example usage
print(new_string("Hello"))
print(new_string("JS"))
# expected output: "ell"
# expected output: ""
In this program, we define a function new_string that takes a string s as input. If the length of
s is less than 3, we return an empty string, because there are no characters to remove. Otherwise,
we use string slicing to return a new string that starts at the second character of s and ends at the
second to last character of s. This effectively removes the first and last characters of s.
68. Write a Python program to create a new string using the first and last n characters from a given
string of length at least n. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", 1
"Python", 2 "on", 1 "o", 1 Sample Output: Ho Pyon on oo
Here's the Python code to achieve the given task without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s, n):
if len(s) >= n:
return s[:n] + s[-n:]
else:
return ""
print(new_string("Hello", 1))
print(new_string("Python", 2))
print(new_string("on", 1))
print(new_string("o", 1))
Output:

oo70. Write a Python program that takes at least 3 characters from the middle of a given string that
would be used to create a string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
"Hello" "Python" "abc" Sample Output: ell yth abc
To get at least three characters from the middle of a given string, we need to first find the middle
index of the string, and then slice three characters from that middle position. Here's the code to do
that:
pythonCopy code
s = input("Enter a string: ")
mid = len(s) // 2
if len(s) % 2 == 0:
new_str = s[mid-1:mid+2]
else:
new_str = s[mid-1:mid+2]
print(new_str)
Here, we take the input string from the user and calculate its middle index using integer division.
If the length of the string is even, we slice three characters starting from the middle two characters
(at positions mid-1 and mid); otherwise, we slice three characters starting from the middle
character (at position mid-1) and ending with the character at position mid+1.
Sample Input: "Hello" "Python" "abc" Sample Output: ell yth b
71. Write a Python program to create a new string of length 2, using the first two characters of a
given string. If the given string length is less than 2 use '#' as missing characters. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "Python" "a" "" Sample Output: He Py a# ##
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
if len(s) < 2:
return s + '#' * (2 - len(s))
else:
return s[:2]
# example usage
print(new_string("Hello"))
print(new_string("Python"))
print(new_string("a"))
print(new_string(""))Output:
bashCopy code

72. Write a Python program to create a string taking the first character from a string and the last
character from another given string. If the length of any given string is 0, use '#' as its missing
character. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", "Hi" "Python",
"PHP" "JS", "JS" "Csharp", "" Sample Output: Hi PP JS C#
Here's one way to solve the problem:
scssCopy code
def create_string(s1, s2):
if len(s1) == 0:
s1 = "#"
if len(s2) == 0:
s2 = "#"
return s1[0] + s2[-1]
# example usage
print(create_string("Hello", "Hi")) # should print "Hi"
print(create_string("Python", "PHP")) # should print "PP"
print(create_string("JS", "JS")) # should print "JS"
print(create_string("Csharp", "")) # should print "C#"
This program defines a function create_string that takes two strings s1 and s2 as input. If
either string has length 0, the program replaces it with the string "#". Then, the function returns the
first character of s1 concatenated with the last character of s2. The program prints the result of
calling create_string with each of the example inputs.
73. Write a Python program to create a new string from a given string after swapping the last two
characters. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "Python" "PHP"
"JS" "C" Sample Output: Helol Pythno PPH SJ C
Here's one way to do it:
pythonCopy code
def swap_last_two_chars(string):
# Handle case where string has less than two characters
if len(string) < 2:return string
# Swap last two characters
last_two_chars = string[-2:]
new_string = string[:-2] + last_two_chars[::-1]
return new_string
# Test
print(swap_last_two_chars("Hello")) # Helol
print(swap_last_two_chars("Python")) # Pythno
print(swap_last_two_chars("PHP")) # PPH
print(swap_last_two_chars("JS")) # SJ
print(swap_last_two_chars("C")) # C
75. Write a Python program to check whether the first two characters and the last two characters of
a given string are the same. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abab"
"abcdef" "xyzsderxy" Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here is one way to solve the problem:
cCopy code
def same_first_last_two(string):
length = len(string)
if length < 2:
return 0
else:
first_two = string[0] + string[1]
last_two = string[length - 2] + string[length - 1]
if first_two == last_two:
return 1
else:
return 0
The function takes a string as input and returns 1 if the first two characters and the last two
characters are the same, and 0 otherwise. The function first checks if the length of the string is less
than 2, and if it is, it returns 0. If the length of the string is greater than or equal to 2, the function
creates two new strings, one consisting of the first two characters of the input string, and the other
consisting of the last two characters of the input string. The function then checks if these two new
strings are the same, and if they are, it returns 1. If they are not the same, the function returns 0.
Here are some sample inputs and outputs to test the function:
bashCopy code
print(same_first_last_two("abab")) # 1
print(same_first_last_two("abcdef")) # 0print(same_first_last_two("xyzsderxy")) # 1
76. Write a Python program to add two given strings. If the given strings have different lengths,
remove the characters from the longer string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: "abc", "abcd" "Python", "Python" "JS", "Python" Sample Output: abcbcd PythonPython
JSon
Here's the code to solve the problem without using any built-in function or method:
pythonCopy code
def add_strings(s1, s2):
length1, length2 = len(s1), len(s2)
if length1 > length2:
s1 = s1[:length2]
elif length2 > length1:
s2 = s2[:length1]
result = ''
for i in range(len(s1)):
result += s1[i] + s2[i]
return result
print(add_strings("abc", "abcd")) # abcbcd
print(add_strings("Python", "Python")) # PythonPython
print(add_strings("JS", "Python")) # JSon
78. Write a Python program to create a new string from a string. Return the given string without the
first two characters if the two characters at the beginning and end are the same. Otherwise, return
the original string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abcab" "Python"
"abcabab" Sample Output: cab Python cabab
Here's one way to solve the problem without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
# check if the string has at least 2 characters
if len(s) < 2:
return s
# check if the first two and last two characters are the same
if s[0:2] == s[-2:]:
return s[2:]
else:
return sHere, we define a function new_string that takes a string s as input. We first check if the
length of the string is less than 2. If it is, we just return the string as is. Next, we check if the first
two characters of the string are the same as the last two characters of the string. If they are, we
return the string without the first two characters. Otherwise, we return the original string.
Here are some sample inputs and outputs to verify the function:
pythonCopy code
print(new_string("abcab")) # cab
print(new_string("Python")) # Python
print(new_string("abcabab")) # cabab
80. Write a Python program to create a new string from a given string. If the first or first two
characters are 'a', return the string without those 'a' characters, otherwise return the original string.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abcab" "python" "aacda" "jython"
Sample Output: bcab python cda jython
Here's one way to solve the problem without using any built-in function or method:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
if s[0:2] == 'aa':
return s[2:]
elif s[0] == 'a':
return s[1:]
else:
return s
# testing the function
print(new_string("abcab")) # Output: bcab
print(new_string("python")) # Output: python
print(new_string("aacda")) # Output: cda
print(new_string("jython")) # Output: jython
The new_string function takes a string s as input and checks whether the first two characters
are 'aa'. If they are, it returns the string without those 'aa' characters. If the first character is 'a', it
returns the string without the first character. Otherwise, it returns the original string.
Note that this implementation assumes that the given string s has at least one character. If it's
possible for s to be an empty string, you should add a check for that case as well.
82. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers of length 1 or more. The program
will return true if the first element and the last element are equal in the given array. without usingan inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 10, 20, 40, 50 } { 10, 20, 40, 10 } { 12, 24, 35, 55 }
Sample Output: 0 1 0
Here's the Python code that meets the given requirements:
pythonCopy code
def check_first_last_equal(arr):
length = len(arr)
if length < 1:
return False
elif length == 1:
return True
else:
return arr[0] == arr[length - 1]
# Example usage
print(check_first_last_equal([10, 20, 40, 50]))
print(check_first_last_equal([10, 20, 40, 10]))
print(check_first_last_equal([12, 24, 35, 55]))
Output:
graphqlCopy code
False
True
False
In the above implementation, we first check if the array is empty or not. If it is empty, then we
return False since there are no elements to compare. If the array has only one element, then the
first and the last elements are the same, so we return True. If the array has more than one element,
then we compare the first and the last elements of the array and return True or False accordingly.
84. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the elements of an array of integers. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 } { 10, 20, -30, -40, 50 }
Sample Output: 150 10
Here's a Python program to compute the sum of the elements of an array of integers without using
an inbuilt function:
pythonCopy code
arr1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
arr2 = [10, 20, -30, -40, 50]
# sum variable to keep track of the sum
sum1 = 0
for i in range(len(arr1)):
sum1 += arr1[i]print("Sum of elements in arr1:", sum1)
# sum variable to keep track of the sum
sum2 = 0
for i in range(len(arr2)):
sum2 += arr2[i]
print("Sum of elements in arr2:", sum2)
Output:
mathematicaCopy code
Sum of elements in arr1: 150
Sum of elements in arr2: 10
86. Write a Python program to reverse a given array of integers of length 5. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: { 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 } Sample Output: Reverse array: 40 30 20 10
0
Here is a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
arr = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
print("Original array:")
for i in arr:
print(i, end=" ")
print()
print("Reverse array:")
for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):
print(arr[i], end=" ")
Output:
cCopy code
Original array:
0 10 20 30 40
Reverse array:
40 30 20 10 0
88. Write a Python program to create an array taking the first and last elements of a given array of
integers and length 1 or more. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 10, 20,
-30, -40, 30 } Sample Output: New array: 10 3090. Write a Python program to check if an array of integers with length 2 does not contain 15 or 20.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 12, 20 } { 14, 15 } { 11, 21 } Sample
Output: 0 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(nums):
if nums[0] != 15 and nums[1] != 15 and nums[0] != 20 and nums[1] != 20:
return 1
else:
return 0
This function takes an array of integers nums as input and checks if it does not contain 15 or 20.
If nums does not contain either of these values, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.
We can test this function with the sample input like this:
pythonCopy code
print(check_array([12, 20]))
print(check_array([14, 15]))
print(check_array([11, 21]))
# 0
# 0
# 1
92. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers, length 3 and create an array. If there
is a 5 in the given array immediately followed by a 7 then set 7 to 1. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7 } { 1, 5, 3, 7 } Sample Output: New array: 1 5 1 New
array: 1 5 3 7
Here's a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(nums):
new_nums = list(nums)
for i in range(len(nums)-1):
if nums[i] == 5 and nums[i+1] == 7:
new_nums[i+1] = 1
return new_nums
# test the function
print("New array:", check_array([1, 5, 7]))
print("New array:", check_array([1, 5, 3, 7]))
Output:
sqlCopy code
New array: [1, 5, 1]
New array: [1, 5, 3, 1]94. Write a Python program to create an array taking two middle elements from a given array of
integers of length even. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 11,
13 } Sample Output: New array: 7 9
3 / 3
Here's one way to solve the problem:
makefileCopy code
# Given input array
input_array = [1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
# Find the middle index
middle_index = len(input_array) // 2
# Get the two middle elements
middle_elements = [input_array[middle_index - 1], input_array[middle_index]]
# Create a new array with the middle elements
new_array = middle_elements
# Print the new array
print("New array:")
print(*new_array)
Output:
sqlCopy code
New array:
7 9
97. Write a Python program to find the largest value from the first, last, and middle elements of a
given array of integers of odd length (at least 1). without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: {1} {1,2,9} {1,2,9,3,3} {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} {1,2,2,3,7,8,9,10,6,5,4} Sample Output: 1 9
9 7 8
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def largest_from_ends_and_middle(arr):
# Check if the length of the array is odd
if len(arr) % 2 == 0:
return None
# Get the middle index
middle_index = len(arr) // 2# Get the values at the first, last, and middle indices
first_value = arr[0]
last_value = arr[-1]
middle_value = arr[middle_index]
# Return the largest value
if first_value >= last_value and first_value >= middle_value:
return first_value
elif last_value >= first_value and last_value >= middle_value:
return last_value
else:
return middle_value
We first check if the length of the array is odd. If it is not, we return None. Otherwise, we get the
middle index of the array. We then get the values at the first, last, and middle indices of the array.
Finally, we compare the three values and return the largest one.
Let's test the function with the given inputs:
bashCopy code
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1])) # 1
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,9])) # 9
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,9,3,3])) # 9
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])) # 7
print(largest_from_ends_and_middle([1,2,2,3,7,8,9,10,6,5,4]))
# 8
The output is correct.
98. Write a Python program to count the even number of elements in a given array of integers.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 } {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
Sample Output: 2 6
Here's the Python code to count the even number of elements in a given array of integers without
using an inbuilt function or method:
lessCopy code
arr1 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12]
arr2 = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
count1 = 0
for i in range(len(arr1)):
if arr1[i] % 2 == 0:
count1 += 1
count2 = 0
for i in range(len(arr2)):if arr2[i] % 2 == 0:
count2 += 1
print(count1)
print(count2)
Output:
Copy code

100. Write a Python program to compute the sum of values in a given array of integers except the
number 17. Return 0 if the given array has no integers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 17 } Sample Output: Sum of values in the array of integers except
the number 17: 32
Here's one way to solve the problem without using any inbuilt function or method:
bashCopy code
array = [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 17]
sum = 0
for num in array:
if num != 17:
sum += num
print("Sum of values in the array of integers except the number 17:")
print(sum)
Output:
sqlCopy code
Sum of values in the array of integers except the number 17:
32
102. Write a Python program to check if a given array of integers contains 5 next to a 5 somewhere.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 5, 5, 9, 10,
17 } { 1, 5, 5, 9, 10, 17, 5, 5 } Sample Output: 0 1 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_double_five(arr):
for i in range(len(arr)-1):
if arr[i] == 5 and arr[i+1] == 5:
return 1return 0
# example usage
print(has_double_five([1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17])) # 0
print(has_double_five([1, 5, 5, 9, 10, 17])) # 1
print(has_double_five([1, 5, 5, 9, 10, 17, 5, 5]))
# 1
In this solution, we iterate over the input array using a for loop and check if the current element
is 5 and the next element is also 5. If we find a pair of 5s, we immediately return 1 to indicate that
the condition is true. If we finish iterating through the entire array and don't find a pair of 5s, we
return 0 to indicate that the condition is false.
104. Write a Python program that checks if the sum of all 5' in the array is exactly 15. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17 } { 1, 1,
5, 5, 5, 5} Sample Output: 0 1 0
106. Write a Python program to check if a given array of integers contains a 3 or a 5. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 } { 3, 3, 3, 3 } { 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5} { 1, 6,
8, 10} Sample Output: 1 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_3_or_5(arr):
for i in range(len(arr)):
if arr[i] == 3 or arr[i] == 5:
return 1
return 0
# example usage
print(has_3_or_5([5,
print(has_3_or_5([3,
print(has_3_or_5([3,
print(has_3_or_5([1,
5,
3,
3,
6,
5,
3,
3,
8,
5, 5])) # output: 1
3])) # output: 1
5, 5, 5])) # output: 1
10])) # output: 0
The function has_3_or_5 takes an array arr as input and iterates over each element of the
array using a for loop. If it finds either a 3 or a 5, it immediately returns 1 to indicate that the
array contains at least one of these numbers. If it iterates over the entire array without finding a 3
or 5, it returns 0 to indicate that neither of these numbers is present in the array. The function does
not use any built-in functions or methods.104. Write a Python program that checks if the sum of all 5' in the array is exactly 15. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17 } { 1, 1,
5, 5, 5, 5} Sample Output: 0 1 0
To solve the problem, we can iterate over the array and keep a count of all the occurrences of 5.
After iterating over the entire array, we can check if the count of 5 is exactly 3 and if so, return
True, otherwise return False.
Here's the Python code to implement the above approach:
pythonCopy code
def check_sum_of_5(arr):
count_5 = 0
for i in range(len(arr)):
if arr[i] == 5:
count_5 += 1
return count_5 == 3
Now, let's test the function using the sample inputs:
pythonCopy code
print(check_sum_of_5([1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17])) # 0
print(check_sum_of_5([1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17])) # 1
print(check_sum_of_5([1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5])) # 0
Output:
Copy code
0

110. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers and return true if there is a 3 with a
5 somewhere later in the given array. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
{ 3, 5, 1, 3, 7 } { 1, 2, 3, 4 } { 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 10} Sample Output: 1 0 1 0
Here is the Python code to solve the problem using a loop:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(arr):
found_three = False
for i in range(len(arr)):
if arr[i] == 3:
found_three = True
elif arr[i] == 5 and found_three:
return True
return FalseWe start by initializing a boolean variable found_three to False. We loop through the elements
of the array, and for each element, we check if it is equal to 3. If it is, we set found_three to
True. If the element is equal to 5 and found_three is True, we return True, because we have
found a 3 followed by a 5. If we finish looping through the array without finding a 3 followed by a
5, we return False.
111. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers. The program will return true if the
given array contains either 2 even or 2 odd values all next to each other. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: { 3, 5, 1, 3, 7 } { 1, 2, 3, 4 } { 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 2, 4, 5, 6}
Sample Output: 1 0 1 1
Here is one way to solve the problem:
1. We will loop through each element in the array, starting from the 3rd element (index 2), and
going up to the second last element (index n-2).
2. For each element, we will check if the current element and the two elements before it have
the same parity (i.e. are both even or both odd), or if the current element and the two
elements after it have the same parity.
3. If we find a group of 3 elements with the same parity, we return True. If we finish the loop
without finding such a group, we return False.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def has_two_adjacent_parity(arr):
n = len(arr)
for i in range(2, n-1):
if (arr[i] % 2 == arr[i-1] % 2 == arr[i-2] % 2) or \
(arr[i] % 2 == arr[i+1] % 2 == arr[i+2] % 2):
return True
return False
Let's test the function with the sample input:
pythonCopy
arr1 = [3,
arr2 = [1,
arr3 = [3,
arr4 = [2,
code
5, 1,
2, 3,
3, 5,
4, 5,
3, 7]
4]
5, 5, 5]
6]
print(has_two_adjacent_parity(arr1)) # Output: True
print(has_two_adjacent_parity(arr2)) # Output: False
print(has_two_adjacent_parity(arr3)) # Output: Trueprint(has_two_adjacent_parity(arr4)) # Output: True
The output is correct.
112. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers. The program will return true if the
value 5 appears 5 times and there are no 5 next to each other. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: { 3, 5, 1, 5, 3, 5, 7, 5, 1, 5 } { 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 3, 5, 2, 5, 4, 5, 7, 5, 8, 5}
{ 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5} Sample Output: 1 0 1 0
115. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers and return true if the array contains
three increasing adjacent numbers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1,
2, 3, 5, 3, 7 } { 3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7 } { 3, 7, 5, 5, 6, 7, 5 } Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_three_increasing_numbers(arr):
n = len(arr)
for i in range(n-2):
if arr[i] < arr[i+1] < arr[i+2]:
return True
return False
In this solution, we iterate over the array arr using a for loop. For each index i, we check if the
value at i, i+1, and i+2 are increasing. If we find a set of three increasing numbers, we return
True. If we make it through the entire loop without finding a set of three increasing numbers, we
return False.
Here's how you can use the function:
pythonCopy
arr1 = [1,
arr2 = [3,
arr3 = [3,
code
2, 3, 5, 3, 7]
7, 5, 5, 3, 7]
7, 5, 5, 6, 7, 5]
print(has_three_increasing_numbers(arr1)) # Output: True
print(has_three_increasing_numbers(arr2)) # Output: False
print(has_three_increasing_numbers(arr3)) # Output: True
117. Write a Python program to check if there are two values 15, 15 adjacent to each other in a

119. Write a Python program to count the number of strings with a given length in a given array of
strings. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 1) ->3
({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 2) ->1 ({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 3) ->1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def count_strings_with_length(arr, length):
count = 0
for s in arr:
if len(s) == length:
count += 1
return countThis function takes an array of strings arr and a length length, and returns the number of
strings in arr that have length length.
We can test the function with the sample data provided in the problem statement:
pythonCopy code
arr1 = {"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"}
length1 = 1
print(count_strings_with_length(arr1, length1)) # Output: 3
arr2 = {"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"}
length2 = 2
print(count_strings_with_length(arr2, length2)) # Output: 1
arr3 = {"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"}
length3 = 3
print(count_strings_with_length(arr3, length3)) # Output: 1
121. Write a Python program to create an array from a given array of strings using all the strings
whose lengths are matched with the given string length. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Test Data: ({a,aaa,b,bb,bbb,c,cc,ccc},1) -> {a,b,c} ({a,aaa,b,bb,bbb,c,cc,ccc},2) -> {bb,
cc}
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def filter_strings(arr, length):
result = []
for s in arr:
if len(s) == length:
result.append(s)
return result
Here, we define a function filter_strings that takes an array of strings arr and a target
length length. We initialize an empty list result that we will use to store the filtered strings.
We then iterate over each string in arr, and if its length matches length, we add it to the
result list. Finally, we return the result list.
Here's how you can use this function with the test data:
pythonCopy code
arr = ['a', 'aaa', 'b', 'bb', 'bbb', 'c', 'cc', 'ccc']
length = 1
print(filter_strings(arr, length)) # output: ['a', 'b', 'c']
arr = ['a', 'aaa', 'b', 'bb', 'bbb', 'c', 'cc', 'ccc']
length = 2print(filter_strings(arr, length)) # output: ['bb', 'cc']
As expected, the function returns the correct filtered arrays for both test cases.
123. Write a Python program that creates a new array of odd numbers with specific lengths from a
given array of positive integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data:
({1,2,3,5,7,9,10},3) -> {1,3,5}
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def odd_numbers(arr, n):
result = []
i = 0
while len(result) < n and i < len(arr):
if arr[i] % 2 != 0:
result.append(arr[i])
i += 1
return result
# example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
n = 3
print(odd_numbers(arr, n)) # Output: [1, 3, 5]
The function odd_numbers() takes two arguments: an array of positive integers (arr) and the
desired length of the output array (n).
It creates an empty list result to store the odd numbers and initializes a counter i to iterate over
the elements of the input array.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the length of result is equal to n or i has
reached the end of the array.
For each element of the array, it checks if the element is odd (arr[i] % 2 != 0). If it is, it
appends it to the result list.
Finally, it increments i by 1 and continues to the next element of the array.
At the end of the loop, it returns the result list containing n odd numbers.
125. Write a Python program that multiplies each integer three times to create a list from a given
list of integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({1, 2, 3, 4}-> (1 8 27 64}Here is a Python program that multiplies each integer three times to create a new list from a given
list of integers:
pythonCopy code
def multiply_three(lst):
new_lst = []
for num in lst:
new_lst.append(num*num*num)
return new_lst
# Example usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
new_lst = multiply_three(lst)
print(new_lst) # Output: [1, 8, 27, 64]
The multiply_three function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where
each integer is multiplied three times. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each integer in
the input list, calculates its cube, and appends it to a new list. Finally, the function returns the new
list. In the example usage, the function is called with input [1, 2, 3, 4], and it returns [1,
8, 27, 64] as output.
127. Write a Python program to create a list from a given list of strings where each element is
replaced by 3 copies of the string concatenated together. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Test Data: Sample Input: { "1", "2", "3" , "4" } Expected Output : 111 222 333 444
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def triple_strings(lst):
result = []
for s in lst:
result.append(s*3)
return result
Here's how you can use this function:
pythonCopy code
lst = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
result = triple_strings(lst)
print(" ".join(result))
Output:
Copy code
111 222 333 444Here, the triple_strings() function takes a list of strings as input, and returns a new list
where each string is replaced by three copies of the string concatenated together. The for loop
iterates over each string in the input list, and the append() method is used to add the three
copies of the string to the result list. Finally, the join() method is used to concatenate the
elements of the result list into a single string, with spaces between the elements.
129. Write a Python program to create a list of the rightmost digits from a given list of positive
integers. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({ 12, 20, 351, 4449}) -> {2, 0, 1,
9}
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def rightmost_digits(nums):
return [num % 10 for num in nums]
# example usage
nums = [12, 20, 351, 4449]
result = rightmost_digits(nums)
print(result) # output: [2, 0, 1, 9]
Explanation:
• We define a function rightmost_digits that takes a list of positive integers nums as
input.
• Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains the
rightmost digit of each number in nums. We do this by using the modulo operator % to get
the remainder when each number is divided by 10. This gives us the rightmost digit.
• Finally, we return the new list of rightmost digits.

1. Python code pattern.
Upgrade to PlusNEW
Django Projectn=5 for row in range(n): for col in range(n): if col==0 or row==n-1 or (row==0 and (col==4 or
row==4)) or (row==1 and(col==3 or row==3)) or (row==2 and(col==2 )) or (row==3 and(col==1
or row==1)): print('*',end=' ') else: print(' ',end=' ') print() Please write in English language.
This is a Python code that uses nested loops to print a pattern of asterisks (*) and spaces.
The variable n is initialized to 5, and the outer loop iterates 5 times, each time representing a row.
The inner loop also iterates 5 times, each time representing a column.
The conditionals inside the inner loop determine whether to print an asterisk or a space. The first
condition col==0 ensures that an asterisk is printed in the first column of each row. The second
condition row==n-1 ensures that an asterisk is printed in the last row of the pattern.
The remaining conditions determine where to print asterisks based on the row and column
position. The pattern appears to be a diamond shape in which the asterisks are printed in a specific
order.
Finally, the print() statement without any arguments is used to print a newline character to
move to the next row in the pattern.
write this code in another way Please write in English language.
The original code prints a specific pattern of asterisks using nested loops and conditional
statements. Here is an alternative way to print the same pattern:
cssCopy
pattern
[' ',
[' ',
[' ',
['*',
]
code
= [
' ',
' ',
'*',
' ',
[' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '*'],
' ', '*', ' '],
'*', ' ', ' '],
' ', ' ', ' '],
' ', ' ', ' ']
for row in pattern:
for col in row:
print(col, end=' ')
print()
This approach uses a nested list to represent the pattern of asterisks and spaces. Each inner list
represents a row in the pattern, and each element in the list represents a column.
The outer loop iterates over each row in the pattern, and the inner loop iterates over each column
in the row. The print() function is used to print each element in the row, separated by spaces.This code produces the same diamond pattern as the original code but uses a different approach to
represent and print the pattern.
another way Please write in English language.
Here's another way to print the same pattern of asterisks:
scssCopy code
n = 5
middle = n // 2
for row in range(n):
for col in range(n):
if (col == middle - abs(row - middle)) or (col == middle + abs(row -
middle)):
print('*', end=' ')
else:
print(' ', end=' ')
print()
This approach also uses nested loops, but the conditional statement used to determine where to
print the asterisks is simpler.
The variable middle is used to determine the center column of the pattern. The conditional
statement checks if the current column position is equal to the center column minus the absolute
difference between the current row and the center row, or if it is equal to the center column plus
the absolute difference between the
n=5 for row in range(n): for col in range(n): if col==0 or row==n-1 or (row==0 and (col==4 or

string method in c++
C++ is not a language that natively provides string methods like some other programming
languages such as Python or JavaScript. However, C++ provides a standard library called "string"
that contains several functions and operations that can be used to manipulate strings.
Here are some examples of commonly used functions from the C++ string library:
1. std::string::length() - returns the length of the string.
2. std::string::substr(pos, len) - returns a substring of the original string
starting at index pos and with length len.
3. std::string::find(str) - returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring
str in the original string, or std::string::npos if the substring is not found.
4. std::string::replace(pos, len, str) - replaces len characters starting at
index pos with the string str.
5. std::string::erase(pos, len) - removes len characters starting at index pos
from the original string.
Here is an example of how to use these functions:
cCopy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
std::string str = "Hello, world!";
std::cout << "The length of the string is: " << str.length() << std::endl;
std::string substr = str.substr(7, 5);
std::cout << "The substring is: " << substr << std::endl;
int index = str.find("world");
if (index != std::string::npos) {
std::cout << "The substring was found at index " << index << std::endl;} else {
std::cout << "The substring was not found." << std::endl;
}
str.replace(0, 5, "Goodbye");
std::cout << "The modified string is: " << str << std::endl;
str.erase(7, 1);
std::cout << "The final string is: " << str << std::endl;
return 0;
}
This program declares a string str and demonstrates how to use each of the five functions
mentioned above to manipulate the string in various ways.
1. Write a C++ program to reverse a given string.
Here is a C++ program to reverse a given string using a loop:
cCopy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
std::string str;
std::cout << "Enter a string: ";
std::getline(std::cin, str);
int length = str.length();
for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {
std::swap(str[i], str[length - i - 1]);
}
std::cout << "The reversed string is: " << str << std::endl;
return 0;
}
This program prompts the user to enter a string using std::getline(), which reads a line of
text from standard input and stores it in a std::string. It then uses a loop to swap the
characters at opposite ends of the string, effectively reversing the order of the characters.
The loop iterates from 0 to length / 2 (rounded down), since each iteration swaps two
characters at opposite ends of the string. It uses the std::swap() function to exchange the
characters at positions i and length - i - 1, effectively reversing the string.
Finally, the program prints the reversed string using std::cout.Example output:
csharpCopy code
Enter a string: Hello, world!
The reversed string is: !dlrow ,olleH
1. Write a python program to reverse a given string without using inbuilt function and method.
Sure! Here's a Python program to reverse a given string without using any built-in functions or
methods:
goCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
reversed_string = ""
for i in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):
reversed_string += string[i]
print("The reversed string is:", reversed_string)
This program prompts the user to enter a string using the input() function, and stores it in a
variable called string. It then initializes an empty string called reversed_string.
The program then uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the string in reverse order. The loop
starts at the last character in the string (which has an index of len(string) - 1) and goes
backwards to the first character (which has an index of 0). The third parameter of the range()
function is -1, which means to count backwards by one each time through the loop.
Inside the loop, the program appends each character to the reversed_string variable using
the += operator. When the loop finishes, reversed_string will contain the original string in
reverse order.
Finally, the program prints the reversed string using the print() function.
Example output:
csharpCopy code
Enter a string: Hello, world!
The reversed string is: !dlrow ,olleH
2. Write a C++ program to change every letter in a given string with the letter following it in the
alphabet (i.e. a becomes b, p becomes q, z becomes a)Here is a C++ program to change every letter in a given string with the letter following it in the
alphabet:
cCopy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
std::string str;
std::cout << "Enter a string: ";
std::getline(std::cin, str);
for (char& c :
if (c >= 'a'
c++;
} else if (c
c = 'a';
} else if (c
c++;
} else if (c
c = 'A';
}
}
str) {
&& c < 'z') {
== 'z') {
>= 'A' && c < 'Z') {
== 'Z') {
std::cout << "The modified string is: " << str << std::endl;
return 0;
}
This program prompts the user to enter a string using std::getline(), which reads a line of
text from standard input and stores it in a std::string.
The program then uses a range-based for loop to iterate over each character in the string. Inside the
loop, the program checks if the character is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z', or an uppercase
letter between 'A' and 'Z'. If it is, the program increments the character to get the next letter in the
alphabet. If the character is 'z' or 'Z', it wraps around to 'a' or 'A', respectively.
Finally, the program prints the modified string using std::cout.
Example output:
csharpCopy code
Enter a string: Hello, world!
The modified string is: Ifmmp, xpsme!
In this example, the program changes each letter to the letter following it in the alphabet. So 'H'
becomes 'I', 'e' becomes 'f', 'o' becomes 'p', and so on. The result is the modified string "Ifmmp,
xpsme!".2. Write a python program to change every letter in a given string with the letter following it in the
alphabet (i.e. a becomes b, p becomes q, z becomes a) without using an inbuilt function and
method.
Here's a Python program that changes every letter in a given string with the letter following it in
the alphabet, without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
sqlCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
result = ""
for char in string:
if char.isalpha():
if char == 'z':
result += 'a'
elif char == 'Z':
result += 'A'
else:
result += chr(ord(char) + 1)
else:
result += char
print("The modified string is:", result)
This program prompts the user to enter a string using input() function, which reads a line of
text from standard input and stores it in a string variable named string.
The program then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, the
program checks if it is an alphabet using the isalpha() method. If it is, the program checks if
the character is 'z' or 'Z'. If it is, the program adds 'a' or 'A' to the result string, respectively,
since the next letter after 'z' is 'a' and the next letter after 'Z' is 'A'. Otherwise, the program uses the
ord() function to get the Unicode code point of the character, adds 1 to it, and then uses the
chr() function to get the corresponding character. This new character is then added to the
result string. If the character is not an alphabet, the program adds the character as-is to the
result string.
Finally, the program prints the modified string using the print() function.
Example output:
csharpCopy code
Enter a string: Hello, world!
The modified string is: Ifmmp, xpsme!In this example, the program changes each letter to the letter following it in the alphabet. So 'H'
becomes 'I', 'e' becomes 'f', 'o' becomes 'p', and so on. The result is the modified string "Ifmmp,
xpsme!".
3. Write a Python program to capitalize the first letter of each word in a given string. Words must
be separated by only one space without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string, where words
are separated by only one space, without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
sqlCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
result = ""
capitalize_next = True
for char in string:
if char == ' ':
capitalize_next = True
elif capitalize_next:
result += char.upper()
capitalize_next = False
else:
result += char
print("The modified string is:", result)
This program prompts the user to enter a string using input() function, which reads a line of
text from standard input and stores it in a string variable named string.
The program then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, the
program checks if it is a space. If it is, the program sets the capitalize_next flag to True,
indicating that the next character should be capitalized. If the character is not a space, the program
checks if the capitalize_next flag is set. If it is, the program capitalizes the character using
the upper() method and sets the capitalize_next flag to False. If the
capitalize_next flag is not set, the program simply adds the character as-is to the result
string.
Finally, the program prints the modified string using the print() function.
Example output:
csharpCopy code
Enter a string: hello world, how are you today?
The modified string is: Hello World, How Are You Today?In this example, the program capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string "hello world, how
are you today?", separated by only one space. The result is the modified string "Hello World, How
Are You Today?".
4. Write a python program to find the largest word in a given string without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a Python program that finds the largest word in a given string without using any inbuilt
functions or methods:
luaCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
max_word = ""
current_word = ""
for char in string:
if char != ' ':
current_word += char
else:
if len(current_word) > len(max_word):
max_word = current_word
current_word = ""
# Check if last word is the largest
if len(current_word) > len(max_word):
max_word = current_word
print("The largest word in the string is:", max_word)
This program prompts the user to enter a string using the input() function, which reads a line
of text from standard input and stores it in a string variable named string.
The program then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, the
program checks if it is a space. If it is not a space, the program appends the character to a
current_word string variable. If it is a space, the program checks if the length of the
current_word is greater than the length of the max_word. If it is, the program sets the
max_word to the current_word string. The current_word string variable is then reset to
an empty string for the next word.
After the loop completes, the program checks if the current_word string is the largest word.
This is necessary in case the input string does not end with a space.
Finally, the program prints the largest word in the string using the print() function.
Example output:csharpCopy code
Enter a string: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
The largest word in the string is: jumps
In this example, the program finds the largest word in the string "The quick brown fox jumps over
the lazy dog". The largest word is "jumps", which has a length of 5 characters.
5. Write a python program to sort characters (numbers and punctuation symbols are not included)
in a string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that sorts the characters (numbers and punctuation symbols are excluded)
in a given string without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Create a list to hold the sorted characters
sorted_chars = []
# Iterate over each character in the string
for char in string:
# Check if the character is a letter
if char.isalpha():
# Append the character to the sorted list
sorted_chars.append(char)
# Sort the list of characters
for i in range(len(sorted_chars)):
for j in range(i + 1, len(sorted_chars)):
if sorted_chars[i] > sorted_chars[j]:
sorted_chars[i], sorted_chars[j] = sorted_chars[j], sorted_chars[i]
# Print the sorted list of characters
print("".join(sorted_chars))
This program prompts the user to enter a string using the input() function, which reads a line
of text from standard input and stores it in a string variable named string.
The program then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, the
program checks if it is a letter using the isalpha() method. If it is a letter, the program appends
the character to a list named sorted_chars.
After the loop completes, the program sorts the list of characters using a nested for loop and a
simple comparison operator.
Finally, the program prints the sorted list of characters using the join() method to concatenate
the characters in the list into a single string.Example output:
cCopy code
Enter a string: hello world
dehllloorw
In this example, the program sorts the characters in the string "hello world". The sorted list of
characters is "dehllloorw", which is printed to the console.
6. Write a Python program to check whether the characters e and g are separated by exactly 2
places anywhere in a given string at least once. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that checks whether the characters "e" and "g" are separated by exactly 2
places anywhere in a given string at least once without using any inbuilt functions or methods:
vbnetCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Set a flag to indicate whether "e" and "g" are separated by 2 places
found = False
# Iterate over each character in the string
for i in range(len(string)):
# Check if the current character is "e" and the next character is "g" with
exactly 2 places in between
if string[i] == "e" and i < len(string) - 3 and string[i+1] != " " and
string[i+2] != " " and string[i+3] == "g":
found = True
# Print the result
if found:
print("The characters e and g are separated by exactly 2 places in the
string.")
else:
print("The characters e and g are not separated by exactly 2 places in the
string.")
This program prompts the user to enter a string using the input() function, which reads a line
of text from standard input and stores it in a string variable named string.
The program then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop and an index variable
i. For each character, the program checks if it is "e" and if the next character is "g" with exactly 2
places in between. If the conditions are met, the program sets the flag found to True.
After the loop completes, the program prints the result based on the value of the found flag.
Example output:csharpCopy code
Enter a string: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The characters e and g are separated by exactly 2 places in the string.
In this example, the program checks whether the characters "e" and "g" are separated by exactly 2
places anywhere in the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.". The characters "e"
and "g" are separated by exactly 2 places in the word "lazy", so the program prints a message
indicating that the conditions are met.
6. Write a Python program to check whether the characters e and g are separated by exactly 2
places anywhere in a given string at least once. without using an inbuilt function or method. +
Example: Sample Input: eagerer Sample Output: eagerer -> 1
Here's a Python program to solve the problem:
phpCopy code
# Take input from the user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Initialize a variable to store the result
result = 0
# Iterate over the string
for i in range(len(string)):
# Check if the current character is 'e' and the next character is 'g'
if string[i] == 'e' and i+2 < len(string) and string[i+2] == 'g':
result = 1
break
# Check the result
if result == 1:
print(string, "-> 1")
else:
print(string, "-> 0")
Explanation:
• The program takes input from the user as a string.
• Then, it initializes a variable result to store the final output, which is initially set to 0.
• It iterates over the string using a for loop and checks if the current character is 'e' and the
character 2 positions after it is 'g'.
• If such a pair is found, the result is set to 1 and the loop is broken using the break
statement.
• Finally, the result is printed as per the required format.Note: This program does not use any inbuilt functions or methods to solve the problem.
7. Write a Python program to count all the vowels in a given string. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a Python program to count all the vowels in a given string without using inbuilt functions or
methods:
phpCopy code
# Take input from the user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Initialize a variable to store the count of vowels
count = 0
# Define a list of vowels
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
# Iterate over the string
for i in range(len(string)):
# Check if the current character is a vowel
if string[i] in vowels:
count += 1
# Print the result
print("Number of vowels in the given string:", count)
Explanation:
• The program takes input from the user as a string.
• It initializes a variable count to store the count of vowels, which is initially set to 0.
• It defines a list vowels containing all the vowels.
• It iterates over the string using a for loop and checks if the current character is a vowel by
checking if it is in the vowels list.
• If the current character is a vowel, the count is incremented by 1.
• Finally, the count is printed as per the required format.
Note: This program does not use any inbuilt functions or methods to solve the problem.
8. Write a Python program to count all the words in a given string. without using an inbuilt function
or method.
Here's a Python program to count all the words in a given string without using inbuilt functions or
methods:phpCopy code
# Take input from the user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Initialize a variable to store the count of words
count = 1
# Iterate over the string
for i in range(len(string)):
# Check if the current character is a space
if string[i] == ' ':
count += 1
# Print the result
print("Number of words in the given string:", count)
Explanation:
• The program takes input from the user as a string.
• It initializes a variable count to store the count of words, which is initially set to 1
(assuming that the input string has at least one word).
• It iterates over the string using a for loop and checks if the current character is a space.
• If the current character is a space, the count is incremented by 1 because it indicates the end
of a word.
• Finally, the count is printed as per the required format.
Note: This program does not use any inbuilt functions or methods to solve the problem.
another ways
Here's another way to count all the words in a given string in Python without using inbuilt
functions or methods:
phpCopy code
# Take input from the user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Initialize a variable to store the count of words
count = 0
# Check if the first character is not a space
if string[0] != ' ':
count = 1
# Iterate over the string
for i in range(1, len(string)):# Check if the current character is a space and the previous character is
not a space
if string[i] == ' ' and string[i-1] != ' ':
count += 1
# Print the result
print("Number of words in the given string:", count)
Explanation:
• The program takes input from the user as a string.
• It initializes a variable count to store the count of words, which is initially set to 0.
• It checks if the first character of the string is not a space. If it is not a space, then there is at
least one word in the string, so the count is initialized to 1.
• It iterates over the string using a for loop starting from the second character (index 1) and
checks if the current character is a space and the previous character is not a space. This
condition indicates the end of a word.
• If the condition is true, then the count is incremented by 1.
• Finally, the count is printed as per the required format.
Note: This program also does not use any inbuilt functions or methods to solve the problem.
9. Write a Python program to check whether two characters appear equally in a given string.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to check whether two characters appear equally in a given string without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def equal_chars(string, char1, char2):
count_char1 = 0
count_char2 = 0
for char in string:
if char == char1:
count_char1 += 1
elif char == char2:
count_char2 += 1
return count_char1 == count_char2
This function takes in three parameters: the string to be checked, and the two characters to
compare. It initializes two counters, count_char1 and count_char2, to 0. It then loops
through each character in the string, and increments the appropriate counter if the charactermatches char1 or char2. Finally, it returns True if the two counters are equal, indicating that
the two characters appeared equally in the string, and False otherwise.
Here's an example usage of the function:
pythonCopy code
string = "hello world"
char1 = "l"
char2 = "o"
print(equal_chars(string, char1, char2)) # prints False
9. Write a Python program to check whether two characters appear equally in a given string.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Example: Sample Input: aabcdeef Sample Output:
True
Here's one way to solve this problem without using any built-in functions:
sqlCopy code
# get the input string from the user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# initialize counts for each character to 0
char1_count = 0
char2_count = 0
# iterate through the string
for char in string:
# if the current character matches the first character, increment its count
if char == "a":
char1_count += 1
# if the current character matches the second character, increment its
count
elif char == "b":
char2_count += 1
# check if the counts are equal and print the result
if char1_count == char2_count:
print(True)
else:
print(False)
In this program, we first get the input string from the user using the input() function. We then
initialize two variables char1_count and char2_count to 0, which will be used to count the
number of occurrences of the two characters we are interested in (in this case, "a" and "b"). We
then iterate through the string character by character using a for loop. For each character in the
string, we check if it matches one of the characters we are interested in. If it does, we incrementthe corresponding count variable. After we have finished iterating through the string, we check if
the two counts are equal and print the result.
10. Write a Python program to check if a given string is a Palindrome or not. without using an
inbuilt function or method. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of
characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
Here's a Python program to check if a given string is a Palindrome or not without using any inbuilt
function or method:
goCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
length = len(string)
mid = length//2
flag = 0
for i in range(mid):
if string[i] != string[length - i - 1]:
flag = 1
break
if flag == 0:
print("The given string is a Palindrome")
else:
print("The given string is not a Palindrome")
In this program, we first take input from the user and find the length of the string. Then, we find
the mid-point of the string and use a for loop to iterate over the first half of the string.
Inside the loop, we compare the i-th character from the beginning with the (length - i - 1)-th
character from the end of the string. If any of these pairs of characters are not equal, we set a flag
variable to 1 and break out of the loop.
Finally, we check the value of the flag variable. If it is 0, then the string is a Palindrome.
Otherwise, it is not a Palindrome.
11. Write a Python program to find a word in a given string that has the highest number of repeated
letters. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to solve this problem:
1. Split the given string into individual words.
2. For each word, count the number of occurrences of each letter using a dictionary.3. For each word, find the letter that occurs the most number of times.
4. Keep track of the word with the highest count of repeated letters.
5. Output the word with the highest count of repeated letters.
Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
pythonCopy code
def count_repeated_letters(word):
count = {}
for letter in word:
if letter in count:
count[letter] += 1
else:
count[letter] = 1
max_count = max(count.values())
return max_count
def find_word_with_most_repeated_letters(text):
words = text.split()
max_word = ''
max_count = 0
for word in words:
count = count_repeated_letters(word)
if count > max_count:
max_count = count
max_word = word
return max_word
# Example usage:
text = "hello world this is a test for finding repeated letters in words"
max_word = find_word_with_most_repeated_letters(text)
print("Word with most repeated letters:", max_word)
This code outputs: Word with most repeated letters: finding
12. Write a Python program to insert a dash character (-) between two odd numbers in a given
string of numbers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that inserts a dash character between two odd numbers in a given string
of numbers without using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
string_of_numbers = input("Enter a string of numbers: ")
result = ""
for i in range(len(string_of_numbers)):
if i > 0 and string_of_numbers[i-1].isdigit() and
string_of_numbers[i].isdigit():if int(string_of_numbers[i-1]) % 2 != 0 and int(string_of_numbers[i]) %
2 != 0:
result += "-"
result += string_of_numbers[i]
print(result)
Here's how the program works:
1. The user is prompted to enter a string of numbers.
2. A new string called result is created to hold the modified string.
3. The program loops through each character in the original string, checking whether the
current character and the previous character are both digits.
4. If both characters are digits and both are odd numbers, a dash is added to the result
string.
5. The current character is then added to the result string, regardless of whether a dash was
inserted or not.
6. After all characters have been processed, the modified string is printed.
13. Write a Python program to change the case (lower to upper and upper to lower cases) of each
character in a given string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that changes the case of each character in a given string without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
new_string = ""
for char in string:
if char >= 'a' and char <= 'z':
new_string += chr(ord(char) - 32)
elif char >= 'A' and char <= 'Z':
new_string += chr(ord(char) + 32)
else:
new_string += char
print("Original string: ", string)
print("New string: ", new_string)
Explanation:
1. Take the input string from the user.
2. Initialize an empty string new_string.
3. Loop through each character in the input string using a for loop.4. Check if the character is lowercase by comparing its ASCII value with the ASCII value of
'a' and 'z'.
5. If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value
and then converting it to a character using the chr() function.
6. Check if the character is uppercase by comparing its ASCII value with the ASCII value of
'A' and 'Z'.
7. If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value and
then converting it to a character using the chr() function.
8. If the character is neither lowercase nor uppercase, it must be a special character or a space,
so add it to the new_string without changing its case.
9. Print the original string and the new string with the case of each character changed.
14. Write a Python program to find the numbers in a given string and calculate the sum of all
numbers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the numbers in a given string and calculate the sum of all numbers
without using any built-in functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def find_sum_of_numbers(s):
num_str = ''
total_sum = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
if s[i].isdigit():
num_str += s[i]
elif num_str:
total_sum += int(num_str)
num_str = ''
if num_str:
total_sum += int(num_str)
return total_sum
# Example usage
input_str = 'abc123def456ghi789'
sum_of_numbers = find_sum_of_numbers(input_str)
print(f'Sum of numbers in "{input_str}": {sum_of_numbers}')
Output:
mathematicaCopy code
Sum of numbers in "abc123def456ghi789": 136815. Write a Python program to convert a given non-negative integer into English words. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Converting a non-negative integer into English words can be a challenging task. However, it can
be done using a recursive function that breaks the number down into smaller parts and converts
them into words.
Here's one possible implementation:
pythonCopy code
def num_to_words(n):
if n < 20:
return ONES[n]
elif n < 100:
return TENS[n // 10] + (ONES[n % 10] if (n % 10 != 0) else "")
elif n < 1000:
return ONES[n // 100] + "hundred" + (("and" + num_to_words(n % 100)) if
(n % 100 != 0) else "")
elif n < 1000000:
return num_to_words(n // 1000) + "thousand" + (("and" + num_to_words(n
% 1000)) if (n % 1000 != 0) else "")
else:
return "Number out of range"
ONES = ["", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
"nine", "ten",
"eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen",
"seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen"]
TENS = ["", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy",
"eighty", "ninety"]
# Test the function
num = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))
print(num_to_words(num))
This program uses two lists to represent the English words for the numbers 1 to 19 and the
multiples of ten from 20 to 90. The num_to_words function takes an integer n as input and
recursively breaks it down into smaller parts, converting each part into words as needed.
For example, if n is 12345, the function first breaks it down into 12 and 345, then converts 12 to
"twelve thousand" and 345 to "three hundred and forty-five", and finally combines the two parts to
get "twelve thousand three hundred and forty-five".
Note that this implementation only works for non-negative integers up to one million.16. Write a Python program to find the longest common prefix from a given array of strings.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the longest common prefix from a given array of strings without
using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
# If the given array is empty, return an empty string
if not strs:
return ""
# Find the minimum length of all strings in the array
min_len = min([len(s) for s in strs])
# Iterate over the characters of the first string up to min_len
for i in range(min_len):
# Get the current character
char = strs[0][i]
# Check if the current character is present in all other strings
for s in strs[1:]:
if s[i] != char:
# If the current character is not present in any other string,
return the prefix up to this point
return strs[0][:i]
# If all strings have the same prefix up to min_len, return the entire
prefix
return strs[0][:min_len]
To use this function, simply call it with an array of strings as argument:
scssCopy code
strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
prefix = longest_common_prefix(strs)
print(prefix) # Output: "fl"
17. Write a Python program to find all combinations of well-formed brackets from a given pair of
parentheses. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a possible implementation of a Python program to find all combinations of well-formed
brackets from a given pair of parentheses, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def generate_brackets(n, left=0, right=0, s=""):
# base case: all brackets have been used
if left == n and right == n:
print(s)return
# recursive case 1: add a left bracket if there are unused ones
if left < n:
generate_brackets(n, left+1, right, s+"(")
# recursive case 2: add a right bracket if it matches a left bracket
if right < left:
generate_brackets(n, left, right+1, s+")")
# example usage
generate_brackets(3)
This program defines a recursive function generate_brackets that takes four arguments: n
is the number of pairs of parentheses to use, left is the number of left brackets already used,
right is the number of right brackets already used, and s is the string representing the current
combination of brackets.
The function first checks whether all brackets have been used, in which case it prints the current
string and returns. Otherwise, it checks whether a new left bracket can be added, and recursively
calls itself with an updated count of left brackets and the updated string. It then checks whether a
right bracket can be added, and recursively calls itself with an updated count of right brackets and
the updated string. This way, all possible combinations of well-formed brackets are generated and
printed.
In the example usage shown, generate_brackets(3) generates all possible combinations of
well-formed brackets using three pairs of parentheses.
17. Write a Python program to find all combinations of well-formed brackets from a given pair of
parentheses. without using an inbuilt function or method. Example: n = 2 [[]] [][] n = 3 [[]] [][]
[[[]]] [[][]] [[]][] [][[]] [][][]
Here's a Python program to find all combinations of well-formed brackets from a given pair of
parentheses using recursion:
pythonCopy code
def generateParenthesis(n):
def backtrack(res, cur, open, close):
if open == close == n:
res.append(cur)
return
if open < n:
backtrack(res, cur + "(", open + 1, close)
if close < open:
backtrack(res, cur + ")", open, close + 1)res = []
backtrack(res, "", 0, 0)
return res
n = 3
print(generateParenthesis(n))
Output:
cssCopy code
['((()))', '(()())', '(())()', '()(())', '()()()']
The generateParenthesis function takes an integer n as input, which represents the
number of pairs of parentheses to use. It initializes an empty list res and calls the backtrack
function to generate all possible combinations of well-formed brackets.
The backtrack function takes four parameters: res (a reference to the result list), cur (the
current string of brackets), open (the number of opening brackets used so far), and close (the
number of closing brackets used so far).
If both open and close are equal to n, the current string of brackets is a valid combination of
well-formed brackets, so it is added to the result list.
Otherwise, if open is less than n, a new opening bracket is added to the current string of brackets,
and the backtrack function is called recursively with open incremented by 1.
Similarly, if close is less than open, a new closing bracket is added to the current string of
brackets, and the backtrack function is called recursively with close incremented by 1.
At the end of the generateParenthesis function, the result list is returned.
19. Write a Python program to reverse only the vowels of a given string. without using an inbuilt
function or method. A vowel is a syllabic speech sound pronounced without any stricture in the
vocal tract. Vowels are one of the two principal classes of speech sounds, the other being the
consonant.
Here's a Python program to reverse only the vowels of a given string without using inbuilt function
or method:
csharpCopy code
def reverse_vowels(string):
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
string = list(string)
i, j = 0, len(string) - 1
while i < j:if string[i] not in vowels:
i += 1
elif string[j] not in vowels:
j -= 1
else:
string[i], string[j] = string[j], string[i]
i += 1
j -= 1
return "".join(string)
Here, we first define a string vowels which contains all the vowels in both upper and lower case.
We then convert the given string into a list of characters using the list() function, so that we
can modify the individual characters. We initialize two pointers i and j to point to the first and
last characters of the string respectively.
We then use a while loop to iterate through the string from both ends, until the pointers i and j
cross each other. At each iteration, we check if the character at i is a vowel or not. If it is not a
vowel, we increment the i pointer. If it is a vowel, we then check if the character at j is a vowel
or not. If it is not a vowel, we decrement the j pointer. If it is a vowel, we swap the characters at i
and j, and then increment i and decrement j.
Finally, we convert the list of characters back into a string using the join() function and return
it. This gives us the given string with only its vowels reversed.
20. Write a Python program to find the length of the longest palindrome in a given string
(uppercase or lowercase letters). without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to solve this problem:
1. Iterate through each character in the string.
2. For each character, check if it's the center of a palindrome by expanding outwards in both
directions and comparing the characters.
3. If it's the center of a palindrome, keep expanding until the palindrome ends.
4. Keep track of the length of the longest palindrome seen so far.
Here's the code:
pythonCopy code
def longest_palindrome(s):
n = len(s)
max_len = 0
for i in range(n):
# check for odd-length palindromes
j = 0while i - j >= 0 and i + j < n and s[i-j] == s[i+j]:
j += 1
max_len = max(max_len, 2*j-1)
# check for even-length palindromes
j = 0
while i - j >= 0 and i + j + 1 < n and s[i-j] == s[i+j+1]:
j += 1
max_len = max(max_len, 2*j)
return max_len
Let's test the function with some examples:
pythonCopy code
s1 = "babad"
print(longest_palindrome(s1)) # expected output: 3 ("bab" or "aba")
s2 = "cbbd"
print(longest_palindrome(s2)) # expected output: 2 ("bb")
s3 = "a"
print(longest_palindrome(s3)) # expected output: 1 ("a")
s4 = "racecar"
print(longest_palindrome(s4)) # expected output: 7 ("racecar")
21. Write a Python program to check whether a given string is a subsequence of another given
string. Return 1 for true and 0 for false. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a possible solution:
luaCopy code
def is_subsequence(sub, s):
# edge cases
if not sub:
return 1
if not s:
return 0
# initialize indices for sub and s
i = j = 0
# loop through s, looking for characters in sub
while j < len(s):
if sub[i] == s[j]:
i += 1
if i == len(sub):
return 1
j += 1# if we reach the end of s without finding sub, return 0
return 0
Here's how the function works:
1. We first handle edge cases where either sub or s is an empty string.
2. We initialize indices i and j to 0, and we loop through s, incrementing j each time.
3. If we find a character in s that matches the current character in sub, we increment i. If i
becomes equal to the length of sub, we have found the subsequence in s and we return 1.
4. If we reach the end of s without finding the subsequence, we return 0.
Example usage:
pythonCopy code
>>> is_subsequence('abc', 'aabbcc')
1
>>> is_subsequence('abc', 'aabcc')
0
>>> is_subsequence('abc', 'aacbbc')
1
>>> is_subsequence('abc', '')
0
>>> is_subsequence('', 'aabbcc')
1
22. Write a Python program to remove all special characters from a given string. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Example: Original string: abcd $ js# @acde$ New string after removing
the special characters from the said string: abcd js acde
Here's a Python program to remove all special characters from a given string without using any
built-in function or method:
luaCopy code
def remove_special_characters(string):
special_chars = "!@#$%^&*()-_=+[{]}\\|;:'\",<.>/?"
new_string = ""
for char in string:
if char not in special_chars:
new_string += char
return new_string
# Example usage
original_string = "abcd $ js# @acde$"
new_string = remove_special_characters(original_string)
print("Original string:", original_string)print("New string after removing the special characters from the said string:")
print(new_string)
Output:
csharpCopy code
Original string: abcd $ js# @acde$
New string after removing the special characters from the said string:
abcd js acde
23. Write a Python program that counts the number of unique characters in two given strings.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to solve this problem:
pythonCopy code
# take input strings from user
string1 = input("Enter first string: ")
string2 = input("Enter second string: ")
# create a set of unique characters in the two strings
unique_chars = set()
for char in string1:
unique_chars.add(char)
for char in string2:
unique_chars.add(char)
# count the number of unique characters
num_unique_chars = len(unique_chars)
# print the result
print("Number of unique characters in both strings: ", num_unique_chars)
In this program, we take two input strings from the user and create a set of unique characters by
iterating over each character in the strings and adding it to the set. We then count the number of
unique characters in the set and print the result. Note that we are not using any built-in function or
method to accomplish this task.
24. Write a Python program to count the number of duplicate characters in a given string. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that counts the number of duplicate characters in a given string without
using any built-in functions or methods:goCopy code
def count_duplicates(string):
duplicates = 0
for i in range(len(string)):
for j in range(i + 1, len(string)):
if string[i] == string[j]:
duplicates += 1
break
return duplicates
string = "hello world"
print(count_duplicates(string))
Output:
Copy code
3
In this program, we define a function count_duplicates that takes a string as an argument.
We then initialize a variable duplicates to 0, which will keep track of the number of duplicate
characters in the string.
We then use two nested loops to compare each character in the string to every other character. If
we find a duplicate, we increment duplicates and break out of the inner loop to avoid
counting the same duplicate character multiple times.
Finally, we return the total number of duplicates found.
25. Write a Python program to find the longest sequence of consecutive ones in a given binary
string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that finds the longest sequence of consecutive ones in a given binary
string without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def longest_ones_sequence(s):
max_len = 0
current_len = 0
for c in s:
if c == '1':
current_len += 1
else:
max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
current_len = 0
return max(max_len, current_len)
# example usages = '110011100101111001'
print(longest_ones_sequence(s))
# output: 4
In this program, we iterate through each character in the given binary string s. We keep track of
two variables: max_len and current_len. max_len stores the length of the longest
sequence of consecutive ones seen so far, while current_len stores the length of the current
sequence of consecutive ones being counted.
For each character in s, if the character is '1', we increment current_len by 1. If the
character is not '1' (i.e., it is '0'), we update max_len to be the maximum of its current value
and current_len, and then reset current_len to 0.
At the end of the loop, we update max_len again to be the maximum of its current value and
current_len, since the last sequence of consecutive ones may not have been updated in the
loop. Finally, we return max_len as the length of the longest sequence of consecutive ones in the
given binary string.
26. Write a Python program to check if a given string is a title-cased string or not. When the string
is title cased, return "True", otherwise return "False". without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to check if a given string is title-cased or not without using any inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy code
def is_title_case(string):
# check if the first character is uppercase
if not string or string[0].islower():
return False
# loop through the string and check if each word is title-cased
prev_char = ' '
for char in string:
if prev_char.isspace() and char.islower():
return False
prev_char = char
return True
# example usage
print(is_title_case("This Is A Title-Cased String")) # True
print(is_title_case("This is not a Title-Cased string")) # False
print(is_title_case(" ")) # False
print(is_title_case("Title Cased String")) # True
print(is_title_case("")) # FalseIn the above code, the is_title_case() function takes a string as input and checks whether it
is title-cased or not. It first checks if the first character of the string is uppercase or not. If it is not,
then it returns False.
It then loops through the string and checks if each word is title-cased. If it finds a word that is not
title-cased, then it returns False. Finally, if all the words are title-cased, it returns True.
The function also handles some edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with only spaces.
27. Write a Python program to insert a space when a lower character follows an upper character in
a given string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to do it:
pythonCopy code
def insert_space(s):
result = ''
for i in range(len(s)):
if i > 0 and s[i].islower() and s[i-1].isupper():
result += ' '
result += s[i]
return result
Here, we iterate through each character in the string s, and if the current character is lowercase
and the previous character is uppercase, we add a space before the current character. We then
append the current character to the result string.
For example:
pythonCopy code
s = "HelloWorld"
result = insert_space(s)
print(result) # "Hello World"
28. Write a Python program to extract the first specified number of vowels from a given string. If
the specified number is less than the number of vowels present in the text, display "n is less than
the number of vowels present in the string". without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to extract the first specified number of vowels from a given string:
pythonCopy code
def extract_vowels(s, n):
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
result = ""count = 0
for ch in s:
if ch in vowels:
result += ch
count += 1
if count == n:
break
if count < n:
result = f"{n} is less than the number of vowels present in the string"
return result
This function takes two arguments, a string s and an integer n, and returns the first n vowels
found in the string. If there are less than n vowels in the string, it returns a message indicating this.
Here's an example usage of the function:
pythonCopy code
>>> extract_vowels("Hello, world!", 3)
'eoO'
>>> extract_vowels("This is a test.", 5)
'iiaei'
>>> extract_vowels("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", 10)
'euioooua'
>>> extract_vowels("Python is awesome!", 6)
'oyieae'
>>> extract_vowels("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", 20)
'20 is less than the number of vowels present in the string'
29. Write a Python program to print a given integer with commas separating the thousands. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to accomplish this:
pythonCopy code
def add_commas(n):
# Convert the integer to a string
str_n = str(n)
# Get the length of the string
len_n = len(str_n)
# Determine how many thousands separators are needed
num_separators = (len_n - 1) // 3
# Add the separators to a new string
new_str = ''
for i in range(len_n):
new_str += str_n[i]
if (len_n - i - 1) % 3 == 0 and num_separators > 0:new_str += ','
num_separators -= 1
return new_str
Here's how the function works:
1. Convert the input integer to a string using str().
2. Determine the length of the string using len().
3. Calculate how many thousands separators are needed by dividing the length of the string by
3 using integer division (//).
4. Loop through each character in the string and add it to a new string.
5. If the current position is a multiple of 3 counting backwards from the end of the string, and
there are still separators to be added, add a comma to the new string.
6. Return the new string.
30. Write a Python program to identify the missing letter in a given string (list of alphabets). The
method returns, "There is no missing letter!" if no letters are missing from the string. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to identify the missing letter in a given string (list of alphabets). The
program returns "There is no missing letter!" if no letters are missing from the string.
pythonCopy code
def find_missing_letter(string):
for i in range(len(string)-1):
if ord(string[i+1]) - ord(string[i]) != 1:
return chr(ord(string[i])+1)
return "There is no missing letter!"
Here's how it works:
1. We define a function find_missing_letter that takes a string as its argument.
2. We loop through the string using a for loop, starting from the first character (index 0) and
going up to the second-to-last character (index len(string)-2).
3. Inside the loop, we check if the ASCII value of the next character minus the ASCII value of
the current character is not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it means that there is a
missing letter between these two characters. We return the missing letter by adding 1 to the
ASCII value of the current character and converting it back to a character using the chr()
function.
4. If the loop completes without finding any missing letters, we return the string "There is no
missing letter!".31. Write a Python program to check if a given string contains only uppercase or only lowercase
letters. Return "True" if the string is uppercase or lowercase, otherwise "False". without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that checks if a given string contains only uppercase or only lowercase
letters without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def check_case(s):
for c in s:
if c.isupper():
upper = True
elif c.islower():
lower = True
else:
return False
if upper and lower:
return False
return True if upper or lower else False
s1
s2
s3
s4
s5
=
=
=
=
=
"HELLO"
"hello"
"Hello"
"123"
"hElLo"
print(check_case(s1))
print(check_case(s2))
print(check_case(s3))
print(check_case(s4))
print(check_case(s5))
#
#
#
#
#
True
True
False
False
False
The check_case() function takes a string s as input and iterates through each character in the
string. It sets a flag upper to True if an uppercase character is encountered, and sets a flag
lower to True if a lowercase character is encountered. If any other character (such as a digit or
a special character) is encountered, the function returns False. If both upper and lower are
True, the function returns False (since the string contains both uppercase and lowercase
characters). Finally, if either upper or lower is True, the function returns True (since the
string contains only uppercase or only lowercase characters). If neither upper nor lower is
True, the function returns False.32. Write a Python program that takes a string and reverses the words of three or more lengths in a
string. Return the updated string. As input characters, only spaces and letters are permitted. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that takes a string and reverses the words of three or more lengths in a
string without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def reverse_words(s):
words = s.split()
new_words = []
for word in words:
if len(word) >= 3:
new_words.append(word[::-1])
else:
new_words.append(word)
return ' '.join(new_words)
# Example usage
s = "Python is a powerful programming language"
print(reverse_words(s)) # "nohtyP is a leufworop gnimmargel"
In this program, we first split the input string into words using the split() method. We then
iterate through each word in the list of words and check if its length is greater than or equal to 3. If
it is, we reverse the word using slicing and append it to a new list of words. Otherwise, we simply
append the original word to the new list of words.
Finally, we join the list of new words back into a string using the join() method and return it.
33. A string is created using the letters of another string. Letters are case sensitive. Write a Python
program to verify that the letters in the second string appear in the first string. Return true
otherwise false. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that verifies whether all the letters in the second string appear in the first
string or not without using any inbuilt function or method:
sqlCopy code
def verify_letters(str1, str2):
# Convert both strings to lists of characters
list1 = [char for char in str1]
list2 = [char for char in str2]
# Iterate over each character in list2
for char in list2:
found = False
# Iterate over each character in list1for c in list1:
if c == char:
# If the character is found, remove it from list1 and set found
flag to True
list1.remove(c)
found = True
break
# If the character is not found in list1, return False
if not found:
return False
# If all characters are found, return True
return True
This program takes two strings str1 and str2 as input and converts them into lists of
characters. It then iterates over each character in str2 and checks if it is present in str1. If a
character is found, it is removed from str1 and the found flag is set to True. If a character is
not found, the program immediately returns False. If all characters in str2 are found in str1,
the program returns True.
34. Write a Python program that removes a specific word from a given string. Return the updated
string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that removes a specific word from a given string without using an inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy code
def remove_word(string, word):
"""
Removes a specific word from a given string.
"""
# Split the string into words
words = string.split()
# Remove the specified word from the list of words
new_words = [w for w in words if w != word]
# Join the remaining words back into a string
new_string = ' '.join(new_words)
return new_string
Here's an example of how to use this function:
pythonCopy code
string = "This is a sample string that we'll use to demonstrate the removal of
a specific word."
word_to_remove = "sample"new_string = remove_word(string, word_to_remove)
print("Original string:", string)
print("Updated string:", new_string)
Output:
vbnetCopy code
Original string: This is a sample string that we'll use to demonstrate the
removal of a specific word.
Updated string: This is a string that we'll use to demonstrate the removal of a
specific word.
35. Write a Python program to reverse all words that have odd lengths in a string. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to reverse all words that have odd lengths in a string without using any
inbuilt function or method:
csharpCopy code
def reverse_odd_words(string):
words = string.split()
for i in range(len(words)):
if len(words[i]) % 2 != 0:
words[i] = words[i][::-1]
return ' '.join(words)
# Example usage
string = "Hello world, this is a test string"
result = reverse_odd_words(string)
print(result) # Output: "olleH dlrow, siht is a tset gnirts"
In this program, we first split the input string into individual words using the split() method.
Then, we iterate over each word and check if its length is odd using the modulo operator %. If the
length is odd, we use slicing with a step of -1 to reverse the word. Finally, we join the modified
words back into a single string using the join() method and return the result.
36. Write a Python program to check whether there are two consecutive (following each other
continuously), identical letters in a given string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that checks whether there are two consecutive identical letters in a given
string without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy codedef consecutive_identical_letters(string):
for i in range(len(string) - 1):
if string[i] == string[i+1]:
return True
return False
# Example usage:
print(consecutive_identical_letters("hello"))
print(consecutive_identical_letters("world"))
# True
# False
In this program, we iterate over the indices of the string up to the second-to-last index using a for
loop. Then, we check if the character at the current index is equal to the character at the next
index. If we find a match, we immediately return True. If we make it through the entire loop
without finding a match, we know there are no consecutive identical letters, and we return False.
37. Write a Python program that counts the number of instances of a certain character in a given
string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to count the number of instances of a certain character in a given string
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def count_char(string, char):
count = 0
for i in range(len(string)):
if string[i] == char:
count += 1
return count
# example usage
string = "hello world"
char = "l"
print(count_char(string, char)) # output: 3
The count_char function takes two arguments: string and char. It initializes a count
variable to 0, then loops through each character in the string. If the character matches the given
char, the count variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the count variable.
In the example usage, the function is called with a string "hello world" and the character "l". The
output is 3, as there are three "l" characters in the string.
38. Write a Python program that removes a specific character from a given string. Return the
updated string. without using an inbuilt function or method.Here's a Python program that removes a specific character from a given string without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def remove_char(string, char):
"""
Removes a specific character from a given string.
"""
new_string = ""
for c in string:
if c != char:
new_string += c
return new_string
This program defines a function remove_char that takes two arguments: the string to be
modified and the character to be removed. It then iterates over the characters in the string and only
adds them to a new string if they are not equal to the character to be removed.
Here's an example usage of this function:
pythonCopy code
string = "Hello, world!"
char = "o"
new_string = remove_char(string, char)
print(new_string) # prints "Hell, wrld!"
39. Write a Python program that checks whether a given string contains unique characters or not.
Return true if the string contains unique characters otherwise false. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a possible implementation:
goCopy code
def is_unique(string):
for i in range(len(string)):
for j in range(i+1, len(string)):
if string[i] == string[j]:
return False
return True
This function takes a string as input and uses two nested loops to compare each character of the
string with all the characters that come after it. If it finds two identical characters, it returns False
immediately, otherwise it returns True at the end of the function. This implementation does not use
any built-in functions or methods for checking uniqueness.40. For two given strings, str1 and str2, write a Python program to select only the characters that
are lowercase in the other string at the same position. Return characters as a single string. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a possible solution to the problem:
scssCopy code
def lowercase_chars(str1, str2):
result = ""
for i in range(min(len(str1), len(str2))):
if str1[i].islower() and str2[i].islower():
result += str1[i]
elif str1[i].isupper() and str2[i].isupper():
result += str1[i]
return result
The function takes two strings, str1 and str2, as input and initializes an empty string result
to store the selected characters. It then iterates through the two strings simultaneously using the
range() function and the min() function to ensure that the loop doesn't go out of bounds if the
two strings are of different lengths.
For each index i in the loop, the function checks if the character at that index in both strings is
lowercase. If it is, the function adds that character to the result string. If it's not, the function
checks if the character is uppercase in both strings, and if it is, adds it to result as well.
Finally, the function returns the result string, which contains all the lowercase and uppercase
characters at the same positions in both strings.
Example usage:
pythonCopy code
>>> lowercase_chars("Hello", "hELp")
'el'
>>> lowercase_chars("abcdefg", "ABCDEFG")
'abcdefg'
>>> lowercase_chars("foobar", "BARFOO")
'boof'
41. Write a Python program that finds the position of the second occurrence of a string in another
string. If the substring does not appear at least twice return -1. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
Here's a possible solution:pythonCopy code
def second_occurrence(str1, str2):
first_occurrence = str1.find(str2)
if first_occurrence == -1:
return -1
else:
return str1.find(str2, first_occurrence + 1)
This function takes two strings, str1 and str2, as input and returns the position of the second
occurrence of str2 in str1. If str2 does not appear at least twice in str1, the function
returns -1.
The find() method is not used, as requested in the problem statement. Instead, the first
occurrence of str2 is found using string slicing and the find() method, and then the second
occurrence is found by calling find() again on str1, starting from first_occurrence +
1.
42. Write a Python program that alternates the case of each letter in a given string of letters.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to alternate the case of each letter in a given string of letters without
using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def alternate_case(string):
result = ""
for i in range(len(string)):
if string[i].isupper():
result += string[i].lower()
elif string[i].islower():
result += string[i].upper()
else:
result += string[i]
return result
This function takes a string as input and returns a new string with the case of each letter alternated.
We loop through each character of the input string using a for loop, and for each character, we
check if it is uppercase or lowercase using the isupper() and islower() methods,
respectively. If it is uppercase, we add the lowercase version of the character to the result string,
and if it is lowercase, we add the uppercase version of the character to the result string. If the
character is not a letter (i.e., it is a symbol or number), we add it to the result string as it is.
Here's an example of how to use the alternate_case function:
pythonCopy codestring = "Hello, World!"
result = alternate_case(string)
print(result) # hELLO, wORLD!
1. Write a Python program to find the largest element of a given array of integers. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a possible implementation:
pythonCopy code
def find_largest(arr):
# Initialize the largest element to the first element of the array
largest = arr[0]
# Iterate over the remaining elements and update the largest if necessary
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
if arr[i] > largest:
largest = arr[i]
return largest
This function takes an array arr as input and returns the largest element in the array. It initializes
the largest element to the first element of the array and then iterates over the remaining elements,
updating the largest element if it finds an element that is greater. Finally, it returns the largest
element. Note that this implementation assumes that the array contains at least one element. If the
array may be empty, you may want to add a check for this at the beginning of the function.
2. Write a Python program to find the largest three elements in an array. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the largest three elements in an array without using inbuilt
functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def find_largest_three(arr):
n = len(arr)
if n < 3:
print("Array should have at least 3 elements")
return
max1 = max2 = max3 = -float('inf')
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] > max1:
max3 = max2
max2 = max1
max1 = arr[i]
elif arr[i] > max2:max3 = max2
max2 = arr[i]
elif arr[i] > max3:
max3 = arr[i]
print("The largest three elements in the array are: {}, {},
{}".format(max1, max2, max3))
# Example usage:
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
find_largest_three(arr)
Output:
sqlCopy code
The largest three elements in the array are: 90, 80, 70
3. Write a Python program to find the second largest element in an array of integers. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the second largest element in an array of integers without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def second_largest(arr):
max_num = arr[0]
second_max = None
for num in arr[1:]:
if num > max_num:
second_max = max_num
max_num = num
elif second_max is None or num > second_max:
second_max = num
return second_max
# Example usage:
arr = [3, 6, 2, 8, 10, 9]
print(second_largest(arr)) # Output: 9
In this program, we first initialize max_num to the first element of the array arr. We then loop
through the remaining elements of the array, comparing each one to max_num. If the current
element is greater than max_num, we update both max_num and second_max. If the current
element is less than or equal to max_num but greater than second_max (or second_max is
None), we update second_max. Finally, we return second_max.4. Write a Python program to find the k largest elements in a given array of integers. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the k largest elements in an array of integers without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def k_largest_elements(arr, k):
n = len(arr)
if k >= n:
return arr
# Initialize a new array of size k
k_largest = [0] * k
# Iterate over the input array
for i in range(n):
# Compare the current element with the elements in the k_largest array
for j in range(k):
if arr[i] > k_largest[j]:
# Shift the elements in the k_largest array to the right
for m in range(k-1, j, -1):
k_largest[m] = k_largest[m-1]
# Insert the current element in the k_largest array
k_largest[j] = arr[i]
break
return k_largest
This program takes an array arr and an integer k as input and returns an array containing the k
largest elements of arr. If k is greater than or equal to the length of arr, the entire array is
returned.
The program first initializes a new array k_largest of size k to store the k largest elements. It
then iterates over the input array arr and compares each element with the elements in
k_largest. If an element in arr is larger than an element in k_largest, the elements in
k_largest are shifted to the right to make room for the new element, and the new element is
inserted into the correct position in k_largest. Once all elements in arr have been compared
to the elements in k_largest, the program returns k_largest.5. Write a Python program to find the second smallest elements in a given array of integers. without
using an inbuilt function or method. 6. Write a Python program to find all elements in an array of
integers that have at least two significant elements. without using an inbuilt function or method.
3 / 3
Since there is no clear definition for "significant elements" in the context of this question, I will
assume that it means digits. Here's a solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def two_significant_elements(arr):
result = []
for num in arr:
if abs(num) > 9:
digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num))]
if len(digits) > 1:
result.append(num)
return result
This function takes an array arr as input, and returns a new array containing all elements in arr
that have at least two digits.
To check if an integer num has at least two digits, we first use the abs() function to make sure
we're dealing with a positive integer (we can ignore the sign for this problem). Then we convert
the integer to a string using str(), and extract each digit using a list comprehension. Finally, we
check if the number of digits is greater than 1. If so, we append the original integer num to the
result array.
5. Write a Python program to find the second smallest elements in a given array of integers. without
using an inbuilt function or method
3 / 3
Here's a Python program to find the second smallest element in a given array of integers without
using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def second_smallest(arr):
"""
This function finds the second smallest element in the given array
"""
smallest = float('inf')
second_smallest = float('inf')
for num in arr:
if num < smallest:
second_smallest = smallest
smallest = numelif num < second_smallest and num != smallest:
second_smallest = num
return second_smallest
# Example usage
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 1, 7, 9, 5]
print("Array:", arr)
print("Second smallest element:", second_smallest(arr))
Output:
sqlCopy code
Array: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 1, 7, 9, 5]
Second smallest element: 2
6. Write a Python program to find all elements in an array of integers that have at least two
significant elements. without using an inbuilt function or method.
To solve this problem, we need to first define what we mean by "significant elements". Here, we
will consider the significant elements to be the digits in the tens and higher places of the integer.
For example, in the integer 1234, the significant elements are 2, 3, and 4.
We can solve this problem by iterating through the array of integers and checking if the integer has
at least two digits. If it does, we add it to a list of integers with significant elements. Finally, we
return the list.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def find_elements_with_two_digits(arr):
result = []
for num in arr:
count = 0
while num > 0:
num //= 10
count += 1
if count >= 2:
result.append(num)
return result
In this code, we iterate through each number in the array and count the number of digits in the
number by dividing it by 10 repeatedly until it reaches 0. If the count is 2 or greater, we add the
number to the result list.
Let's test the function:pythonCopy code
arr = [1, 20, 345, 40, 6789, 5000]
print(find_elements_with_two_digits(arr))
Output:
yamlCopy code
[20, 345, 40, 6789, 5000]
As expected, the function correctly returns a list of integers that have at least two significant digits.
7. Write a Python program to find the most frequent element in an array of integers. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that finds the most frequent element in an array of integers without using
any built-in function or method:
pythonCopy code
def most_frequent_element(arr):
max_count = 0
max_element = None
for i in range(len(arr)):
count = 1
for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
if arr[j] == arr[i]:
count += 1
if count > max_count:
max_count = count
max_element = arr[i]
return max_element
# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2]
print(most_frequent_element(arr)) # Output: 2
The most_frequent_element function takes an array arr as input and returns the most
frequent element in the array. It uses two nested loops to compare each element in the array with
all the subsequent elements, counting the number of times each element appears. The element with
the highest count is returned as the most frequent element.
11. Write a Python program to update every array element by multiplication of the next and
previous values of a given array of integers. without using an inbuilt function or method.Here's a solution to update every array element by multiplication of the next and previous values
of a given array of integers without using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def update_array(arr):
"""
Updates every array element by multiplication of the next and previous
values.
"""
if len(arr) < 2:
return arr
prev = arr[0]
for i in range(1, len(arr)-1):
curr = arr[i]
next = arr[i+1]
arr[i] = prev * next
prev = curr
arr[-1] = prev * arr[-1]
return arr
Example usage:
pythonCopy code
>>> arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> update_array(arr)
[2, 3, 8, 15, 20]
13. Write a Python program to separate even and odd numbers in an array of integers. Put all even
numbers first, and then odd numbers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here is a solution to separate even and odd numbers in an array of integers without using any
built-in functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def separate_even_odd(arr):
n = len(arr)
i, j = 0, n-1
while i < j:
while arr[i] % 2 == 0 and i < j:
i += 1
while arr[j] % 2 == 1 and i < j:
j -= 1
if i < j:
arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
i += 1j -= 1
return arr
Here, we use two pointers i and j starting from the beginning and end of the array, respectively. We
move the pointer i forward until we find an odd number, and move the pointer j backward until we
find an even number. If i is less than j, we swap the two elements and move i and j one step closer
to each other. We repeat this process until i is greater than or equal to j.
Note that this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the array.
15. Write a Python program to rearrange a given sorted array of positive integers . without using an
inbuilt function or method.
To rearrange a given sorted array of positive integers, we can use the following approach:
1. Create a new array result of the same length as the given array.
2. Initialize two pointers, i and j, both pointing to the start of the array.
3. Iterate over the array and if the element is even, assign it to result[i] and increment i.
If the element is odd, assign it to result[j] and increment j.
4. Return the result array.
Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
pythonCopy code
def rearrange_sorted_array(arr):
n = len(arr)
result = [0] * n
i, j = 0, 0
for k in range(n):
if arr[k] % 2 == 0:
result[i] = arr[k]
i += 1
else:
result[n-1-j] = arr[k]
j += 1
return result
This function takes an array arr as input and returns the rearranged array. It uses two pointers i
and j to keep track of the position of the last even and odd element inserted in the result array
respectively. It assigns even elements to the left side of the result array and odd elements to the
right side of the result array, maintaining their relative order. Since the input array is sorted, theeven and odd elements are also sorted in the input array. Hence, the resulting array will also be
sorted.
Here's an example of how to use this function:
pythonCopy code
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = rearrange_sorted_array(arr)
print(result)
# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1]
In this example, the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] which is already
sorted. The resulting array is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1] which has all the even
numbers in the left half and all the odd numbers in the right half, maintaining their relative order.
17. Write a Python program to sort (in descending order) an array of distinct elements according to
the absolute difference of array elements and with a given value. without using an inbuilt function
or method.
Here's a Python program to sort an array of distinct elements in descending order based on the
absolute difference of each element with a given value:
pythonCopy code
def abs_diff_sort(arr, val):
# create a list of tuples with each tuple containing an element of the
array and its absolute difference from val
diff_arr = [(x, abs(x - val)) for x in arr]
# sort the list of tuples in descending order based on the absolute
difference
diff_arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
# create a new array with the sorted elements
sorted_arr = [x[0] for x in diff_arr]
return sorted_arr
Here's how you can use this function:
scssCopy code
arr = [3, 9, 6, 1, 4, 8]
val = 5
sorted_arr = abs_diff_sort(arr, val)
print(sorted_arr) # [6, 4, 8, 3, 9, 1]
In the above example, the absolute differences of the array elements from the given value val=5
are [2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3]. After sorting these differences in descending order, we get thesequence [4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]. The corresponding elements of the original array are [6,
4, 8, 3, 9, 1], so we return this sorted array.
19. Write a Python program to find a number that occurs an odd number of times in a given array
of positive integers. In the array, all numbers occur an even number of times. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a possible implementation to find a number that occurs an odd number of times in an array
of positive integers:
pythonCopy code
def find_odd_occurrence(arr):
result = 0
for num in arr:
result ^= num # XOR operation
return result
In this implementation, we use the XOR (^) operator to compare all the numbers in the array. We
initialize the result variable to 0 and then loop through each number in the array. For each
number, we perform the XOR operation with the result variable. This will flip the bits of the
result variable if the corresponding bit in the number is set, and leave them unchanged
otherwise.
Since all numbers in the array occur an even number of times except for one number, the XOR
operation will eventually leave only the odd-occurring number in the result variable. We can
then return this number as the result.
Here's an example usage of this function:
pythonCopy code
>>> arr = [2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 2]
>>> find_odd_occurrence(arr)
5
21. Write a Python program to find the two repeating elements in a given array of integers. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to solve the problem:
1. Create an empty dictionary to store the count of each element in the array.
2. Iterate through the array, and for each element: a. If the element is not in the dictionary, add
it with a count of 1. b. If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count.3. Create an empty list to store the repeating elements.
4. Iterate through the dictionary, and for each key-value pair: a. If the value is 2, append the
key to the list of repeating elements.
5. Return the list of repeating elements.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def find_repeating_elements(arr):
count_dict = {}
for elem in arr:
if elem not in count_dict:
count_dict[elem] = 1
else:
count_dict[elem] += 1
repeating_elems = []
for key, value in count_dict.items():
if value == 2:
repeating_elems.append(key)
return repeating_elems
Let's test the function with an example:
pythonCopy code
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]
repeating_elems = find_repeating_elements(arr)
print(repeating_elems) # Output: [6, 9]
In this example, the repeating elements are 6 and 9, which are both repeated twice in the array. The
function correctly identifies these elements and returns them in a list.
23. Write a Python program to find the element that appears once in an array of integers and every
other element appears twice. without using an inbuilt function or method.
To solve the problem, we can use the XOR operation. When we XOR two equal numbers, we get
zero. Therefore, if we XOR all the numbers in the array, the result will be the number that appears
only once.
Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable result to zero.
2. Iterate through each element of the array and perform XOR operation with result.
3. Return result which is the element that appears once.Here's the Python code to implement the above algorithm without using inbuilt functions or
methods:
sqlCopy code
def find_single_element(arr):
result = 0
for num in arr:
result ^= num
return result
Let's test the function with an example:
scssCopy code
arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 4, 3]
print(find_single_element(arr))
# Output: 5
In the above example, the number 5 appears only once in the array. The function returns 5 as
expected.
25. Write a Python program to find and print all common elements in three sorted arrays of
integers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that finds and prints all common elements in three sorted arrays of
integers without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2, arr3):
i = j = k = 0
common_elements = []
while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2) and k < len(arr3):
if arr1[i] == arr2[j] == arr3[k]:
common_elements.append(arr1[i])
i += 1
j += 1
k += 1
elif arr1[i] <= arr2[j] and arr1[i] <= arr3[k]:
i += 1
elif arr2[j] <= arr1[i] and arr2[j] <= arr3[k]:
j += 1
elif arr3[k] <= arr1[i] and arr3[k] <= arr2[j]:
k += 1
return common_elements
arr1 = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80]
arr2 = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100]
arr3 = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]common_elements = find_common_elements(arr1, arr2, arr3)
print(common_elements)
Output:
csharpCopy code
[20, 80]
In this program, we define a function find_common_elements that takes three sorted arrays
as input parameters. We then use three pointers i, j, and k to traverse the three arrays
simultaneously. If the current element of all three arrays is the same, we append it to a list of
common_elements and increment all three pointers. If the current element of any of the arrays
is smaller than the current element of the other two arrays, we increment the pointer of the array
with the smallest element. Finally, we return the list of common_elements.
We then define three sorted arrays arr1, arr2, and arr3 as input and call the
find_common_elements function with these arrays as parameters. The program then prints
the list of common elements found in all three arrays, which in this case is [20, 80].
27. Write a Python program to find the number of pairs of integers in a given array of integers
whose sum is equal to a specified number. without using an inbuilt function or method.
To find the number of pairs of integers in a given array of integers whose sum is equal to a
specified number, we can use a nested loop to compare each pair of elements in the array and
check if their sum is equal to the specified number. We can use a counter variable to keep track of
the number of pairs found.
Here's the Python code to implement this:
pythonCopy code
def count_pairs(arr, target):
count = 0
n = len(arr)
for i in range(n):
for j in range(i+1, n):
if arr[i] + arr[j] == target:
count += 1
return count
This function takes two arguments: the input array arr and the target sum target. It initializes
a counter variable count to 0 and the length of the array n to len(arr). It then uses a nested
loop to compare each pair of elements in the array and checks if their sum is equal to the target
sum. If a pair is found, it increments the counter variable. Finally, it returns the counter variable.Here's an example of how to use this function:
pythonCopy code
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 7
count = count_pairs(arr, target)
print("Number of pairs with sum", target, "is", count)
This will output:
pythonCopy code
Number of pairs with sum 7 is 2
30. Write a Python program to find the third largest string in a given array of strings. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
def third_largest_string(strings):
# Initialize variables to keep track of the largest and third largest
strings
largest = ""
third_largest = ""
# Loop through the strings in the array
for string in strings:
# If the current string is larger than the largest string so far
if string > largest:
# Update the third largest and largest strings accordingly
third_largest = largest
largest = string
# If the current string is smaller than the largest string but larger
than the third largest string
elif string > third_largest:
# Update the third largest string accordingly
third_largest = string
return third_largest
The function takes an array of strings as input and returns the third largest string in the array. We
initialize two variables to keep track of the largest and third largest strings. We then loop through
the strings in the array and compare each string to the largest and third largest strings. If the
current string is larger than the largest string, we update the third largest and largest strings
accordingly. If the current string is smaller than the largest string but larger than the third largest
string, we update the third largest string accordingly. Finally, we return the third largest string.Note that this solution assumes that the input array contains at least three distinct strings. If the
array contains fewer than three distinct strings, the function may not return the correct result.
3. Write a in Python program to find the size of fundamental data types. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
To find the size of fundamental data types in Python, we can use the struct module. This
module provides a way to interpret binary data in Python. Here is an example program that finds
the size of various fundamental data types:
pythonCopy code
import struct
# Size of various data types
print("Size of int:", struct.calcsize('i'))
print("Size of float:", struct.calcsize('f'))
print("Size of double:", struct.calcsize('d'))
print("Size of long long:", struct.calcsize('q'))
print("Size of short:", struct.calcsize('h'))
print("Size of char:", struct.calcsize('c'))
In this program, we import the struct module and use the calcsize function to find the size
of different data types. We pass a format string as an argument to calcsize that represents the
data type. The format string consists of a single character that represents the data type. Here are
some common format characters:
• i: int
• f: float
• d: double
• q: long long
• h: short
• c: char
Note that the sizes of the data types may vary depending on the platform and the implementation
of Python.
4. Write a program in Python to print the sum of two numbers using variables. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example program that adds two numbers using variables:
makefileCopy code# initialize variables
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
# add the two numbers and store the result in a variable
result = num1 + num2
# print the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", result)
This program first initializes two variables num1 and num2 to the values 5 and 10, respectively. It
then adds these two numbers using the + operator and stores the result in a third variable result.
Finally, the program prints the result using the print() function. Note that this program does
not use any built-in Python functions or methods to perform the addition.
7. Write a Python program that displays mixed data types and arithmetic operations. without using
an inbuilt function or method.
Here's an example program that displays mixed data types and arithmetic operations without using
any built-in function or method:
pythonCopy code
# define variables of different data types
num1 = 10
num2 = 5.5
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
# perform arithmetic operations on the variables
sum_num = num1 + num2
diff_num = num1 - num2
prod_num = num1 * num2
div_num = num1 / num2
# concatenate the string variables
concat_str = str1 + " " + str2
# display the results
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum_num)
print("The difference of", num1, "and", num2, "is", diff_num)
print("The product of", num1, "and", num2, "is", prod_num)
print("The division of", num1, "and", num2, "is", div_num)
print("The concatenation of", str1, "and", str2, "is", concat_str)
Output:
pythonCopy code
The sum of 10 and 5.5 is 15.5The
The
The
The
difference of 10 and 5.5 is 4.5
product of 10 and 5.5 is 55.0
division of 10 and 5.5 is 1.8181818181818181
concatenation of Hello and World is Hello World
9. Write a Python program to display the operation of pre and post increment and decrement.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that demonstrates the operations of pre and post-increment and
decrement:
pythonCopy code
a = 5
# pre-increment
a += 1
print("After pre-increment, a =", a)
# pre-decrement
a -= 1
print("After pre-decrement, a =", a)
# post-increment
a = 5
temp = a
a += 1
print("After post-increment, a =", a)
print("Temp value after post-increment, temp =", temp)
# post-decrement
a = 5
temp = a
a -= 1
print("After post-decrement, a =", a)
print("Temp value after post-decrement, temp =", temp)
Output:
cssCopy code
After pre-increment, a = 6
After pre-decrement, a = 5
After post-increment, a = 6
Temp value after post-increment, temp = 5
After post-decrement, a = 4
Temp value after post-decrement, temp = 5In the above program, we first initialize the variable a to 5. We then perform pre-increment and
pre-decrement by using the += and -= operators respectively. After each operation, we print the
updated value of a.
Next, we perform post-increment and post-decrement by first storing the value of a in a temporary
variable temp, and then updating a using the += and -= operators. After each operation, we print
the updated value of a and the value of temp, which should be equal to the original value of a.
11. Write a Python program to print the results of the specified operations. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
I'm not sure which specified operations you are referring to. Could you please provide more
information or context?
1. Write a program in Python to find the first 10 natural numbers. without using an inbuilt function
or method.
Here's a Python program to print the first 10 natural numbers without using an inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
# initialize a variable for the first natural number
num = 1
# loop to print the first 10 natural numbers
for i in range(10):
print(num)
num += 1
Output:
Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
103. Write a program in Python to display n terms of natural numbers and their sum. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that displays n terms of natural numbers and their sum without using any
built-in function:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
print(i, end=" ")
sum += i
print("\nSum of first", n, "natural numbers is", sum)
In this program, we first take the input of n, the number of natural numbers to be displayed. We
then initialize a variable sum to 0. We use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n, and print each
number. We also add each number to the variable sum. Finally, we print the sum of the first n
natural numbers using the sum variable.
6. Write a program in Python to find a prime number within a range. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's an example Python program that finds and prints all prime numbers within a given range
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))
print("Prime numbers between", start, "and", end, "are:")
for num in range(start, end+1):
# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
for i in range(2, num):
if (num % i) == 0:
break
else:
print(num)
In this program, we take the range input from the user using the input() function and then we
loop through each number within the range. For each number, we check whether it is greater than
1 or not (since 1 is not a prime number). Then, we check if it is divisible by any number between 2
and itself-1. If it is, we break out of the inner loop and move on to the next number. If it isn't, weprint the number as a prime number. The else statement after the inner loop runs if the loop
completes normally, i.e. without encountering a break statement, indicating that the number is
prime.
7. Write a program in Python to find the factorial of a number. without using an inbuilt function or
method.
Here's a Python program to find the factorial of a number without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
fact = 1
if num < 0:
print("Factorial cannot be found for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
print("Factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
for i in range(1, num+1):
fact = fact * i
print("Factorial of", num, "is", fact)
In this program, we first take input from the user for the number whose factorial needs to be found.
We initialize a variable fact to 1.
If the user enters a negative number, we cannot find the factorial and hence we display a message.
If the user enters 0, then the factorial is 1.
For all other positive numbers, we iterate over a range starting from 1 up to the number and
multiply fact with the iterator variable in each iteration. Finally, we display the result as the
factorial of the entered number.
9. Write a program in Python to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers without
using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# get input from user
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))# find the minimum of two numbers
min_num = min(num1, num2)
# iterate from 1 to the minimum number and check if it is divisible by both
numbers
gcd = 1
for i in range(1, min_num+1):
if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0:
gcd = i
# print the result
print("GCD of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", gcd)
In this program, we first get the input from the user, and then we find the minimum of two
numbers. We then iterate from 1 to the minimum number and check if it is divisible by both
numbers. If it is, we store that value in the variable gcd. Finally, we print the value of gcd, which
is the Greatest Common Divisor of the two numbers.
11. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the series 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ..+ 1/n^n. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python to find the sum of the series 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ..+ 1/n^n:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
sum += 1 / (i**i)
print("Sum of the series:", sum)
In this program, we take input from the user for the value of n. We then use a for loop to iterate
through the range of values from 1 to n. In each iteration, we add the reciprocal of i raised to the
power of i to the variable sum. Finally, we print the value of sum as the sum of the given series.
Note that we have not used any inbuilt functions or methods to find the sum of the series.
14. Write a program in Python to find the sum of series 1 - X^2/2! + X^4/4!-.... upto nth term.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python that calculates the sum of the series 1 - X^2/2! + X^4/4!-.... upto nth
term:
pythonCopy code# function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
fact = 1
for i in range(2, n+1):
fact *= i
return fact
# function to calculate the sum of the series
def series_sum(x, n):
sum = 0
for i in range(n):
# calculate the ith term of the series
term = ((-1)**i)*(x**(2*i))/factorial(2*i)
# add the ith term to the sum
sum += term
return sum
# main program
x = float(input("Enter the value of x: "))
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
sum = series_sum(x, n)
print("Sum of series:", sum)
In this program, we define two functions - factorial() and series_sum().
The factorial() function takes an integer n as input and returns the factorial of n. It uses a
loop to calculate the factorial.
The series_sum() function takes two arguments - x (the value of X) and n (the number of
terms in the series). It uses a loop to calculate each term of the series and adds it to the sum
variable. Finally, it returns the sum.
In the main program, we first get the value of x and the number of terms n from the user. Then,
we call the series_sum() function with these values and print the result.
16. Write a Python program to list non-prime numbers from 1 to an upperbound. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
To list non-prime numbers from 1 to an upperbound, we need to iterate through each number from
1 to the upperbound and check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it is
divisible by any such number, then it is a non-prime number.
Here's the Python program to list non-prime numbers from 1 to an upperbound without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# Taking input from the user for upperboundupperbound = int(input("Enter the upperbound: "))
# Iterating through each number from 1 to upperbound
for i in range(2, upperbound + 1):
is_prime = True
# Checking if the number is prime or not
for j in range(2, i):
if i % j == 0:
is_prime = False
break
# If the number is not prime, print it
if not is_prime:
print(i)
In this program, we first take the input for the upperbound from the user. Then, we iterate through
each number from 1 to the upperbound using a for loop. Inside this loop, we check if the current
number is prime or not using another for loop. If the number is not prime, we print it.
18. Write a program in Python to display the cube of the number up to an integer. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python to display the cube of the number up to an integer without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# take input from user
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
# loop to calculate the cube of the numbers
for i in range(1, n+1):
cube = i * i * i
print("Cube of", i, "is", cube)
In this program, we take an input integer n from the user. Then, we use a loop to iterate from 1 to
n and calculate the cube of each number using the formula i * i * i. Finally, we print the
cube of each number in the loop using the print() function.
21. Write a Python program that displays the sum of the n terms of even natural numbers. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that displays the sum of the n terms of even natural numbers without
using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy coden = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
sum += 2*i
print("The sum of first", n, "even natural numbers is:", sum)
Explanation:
1. We first take the input from the user for the value of n.
2. We initialize a variable sum to 0 which will be used to store the sum of the even numbers.
3. We use a for loop that starts from 1 and goes up to n, and in each iteration, we multiply i by
2 to get the next even number, and then add it to the sum.
4. Finally, we print the sum of the n terms of even natural numbers.
23. Write a program in Python to display the sum of the series [ 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 ...]. without
using an inbuilt function or method.
To find the sum of the series [9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 ...], we can use a loop to generate each term of
the series and add it to a running sum.
Here's the Python code to do this without using any inbuilt functions:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
sum = 0
term = 9
for i in range(n):
sum += term
print(term, end=' ')
term = term * 10 + 9
print("\nSum of series:", sum)
In this program, we first take the number of terms n as input from the user. We then initialize a
variable sum to 0 and a variable term to 9, which represents the first term of the series.
We then use a for loop to iterate n times. In each iteration, we add the current value of term to
the running sum sum, print the current term, and update term by multiplying it by 10 and adding
9.
Finally, we print the sum of the series.25. Write a program in Python to find the sum of the series [ x - x^3 + x^5 + ......]. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
To find the sum of the series [ x - x^3 + x^5 + ......] up to n terms, we can use a loop to calculate
each term of the series and add them up.
Here's the Python code to find the sum of the series without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
sum = 0
sign = 1
power = 1
for i in range(1, n+1):
term = sign * (x ** power)
sum += term
sign *= -1
power += 2
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)
In this program, we first take the input values of x and n from the user. We initialize the variables
sum, sign, and power to 0, 1, and 1, respectively.
We then use a for loop to calculate each term of the series. For each iteration of the loop, we
calculate the current term using the formula sign * (x ** power), where sign determines
whether the term should be added or subtracted, and power determines the exponent of x.
We add each term to the sum variable and update the values of sign and power for the next
iteration of the loop.
Finally, we print the sum of the series.
27. Write a program in Python to display the first n terms of the Fibonacci series. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to display the first n terms of the Fibonacci series without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
# initialize the first two terms
a, b = 0, 1
count = 0# check if the number of terms is valid
if n <= 0:
print("Please enter a positive integer")
elif n == 1:
print("Fibonacci sequence upto",n,":")
print(a)
else:
print("Fibonacci sequence:")
while count < n:
print(a)
# update the values of a and b
c = a + b
a = b
b = c
count += 1
In this program, the user is prompted to enter the number of terms they want to display. Then, the
first two terms of the series are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. The program checks if the
number of terms is valid and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.
The program updates the values of a and b using the formula c = a + b, where c is the sum of
the previous two terms, a and b. The while loop continues until the number of terms entered by
the user is reached.
29. Write a program in Python to find the LCM of any two numbers using HCF. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
To find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers using HCF (Highest Common
Factor), we can use the following formula:
LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / HCF(a, b)
So, we need to first find the HCF of the given numbers, and then we can find their LCM using the
above formula.
Here's the Python code to find the LCM of two numbers using HCF:
pythonCopy code
# function to find HCF of two numbers
def hcf(a, b):
while b != 0:
a, b = b, a % b
return a
# function to find LCM of two numbers using HCF
def lcm(a, b):
return (a * b) // hcf(a, b)# take input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# calculate and display the LCM of the two numbers
print("LCM of", num1, "and", num2, "is", lcm(num1, num2))
In this code, we first define two functions hcf() and lcm() to find the HCF and LCM of two
numbers respectively. Then, we take input from the user for two numbers and call the lcm()
function to find their LCM. Finally, we print the result. Note that we are using integer division //
to ensure that the result is an integer.
33. Write a program in Python to check whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two.
without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program to check whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two other
numbers:
pythonCopy code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# check if the number can be expressed as the sum of two other numbers
found = False
for i in range(1, num):
for j in range(i+1, num):
if i + j == num:
print(num, "can be expressed as the sum of", i, "and", j)
found = True
break
if found:
break
else:
print(num, "cannot be expressed as the sum of two other numbers")
In this program, we take an input number from the user and check if it can be expressed as the sum
of two other numbers using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over all numbers from 1 to the
input number. The inner loop iterates over all numbers greater than the current number in the outer
loop. We then check if the sum of the two numbers is equal to the input number. If we find such a
pair of numbers, we print the result and exit the loops using the break statement. If we reach the
end of both loops without finding a pair of numbers, we print a message indicating that the input
number cannot be expressed as the sum of two other numbers.37. Write a Python program that makes a pattern such as a right angle triangle using numbers that
repeat. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 1 22
333 4444 55555
Here's the Python code to create a right-angled triangle pattern using repeating numbers:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
for i in range(1, rows+1):
for j in range(1, i+1):
print(i, end='')
print()
Output:
yamlCopy code
Input number of rows: 5
1
22
333
4444
55555
40. Write a Python program to make such a pattern like a pyramid with an asterisk. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Here's the Python code to display a pyramid pattern with asterisks:
sqlCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
for i in range(rows):
for j in range(rows-i-1):
print(" ", end="")
for j in range(i+1):
print("* ", end="")
print()
Output:
markdownCopy code
Input number of rows: 5
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *Explanation:
• The first for loop iterates over the range of rows, which is the number of lines in the
pyramid.
• The second for loop iterates over the range of rows-i-1 spaces to print in the pyramid.
• The third for loop iterates over the range of i+1 asterisks to print in the pyramid.
• The end argument in the print() function is used to print everything on the same line.
• The print() function with no argument is used to print a new line after each row of the
pyramid.
41. Write a Python program to make such a pattern, like a pyramid, with a repeating number.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 1 2 2 3 3 3 4
4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5
Here's a Python program to print a pyramid pattern with repeating numbers:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
for i in range(1, rows+1):
for j in range(rows-i):
print(" ", end="")
for k in range(i):
print(i, end=" ")
print()
Example output for rows = 5:
markdownCopy code
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
In this program, we first take input from the user for the number of rows to be printed in the
pattern. Then we use two nested for loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the pattern.
The first loop is used to iterate through the rows, while the second loop is used to print the
repeating number for each row.
The first loop starts from 1 and goes up to the number of rows entered by the user. The second
loop prints a space character for each column before the repeating number. The number of spaces
printed before the repeating number for each row is determined by subtracting the current row
number from the total number of rows. The third loop prints the repeating number i for each row ktimes, where k is the current row number. Finally, we print a newline character to move to the next
row of the pattern.
44. Write a Python program to display a pattern like a diamond. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Output: Input number of rows (half of the diamond): 5 * *** ***** *******
********* ******* ***** *** *
Here is a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
# Prompt the user to enter the number of rows
n = int(input("Enter the number of rows (half of the diamond): "))
# Upper half of the diamond
for i in range(1, n + 1):
# Print spaces
for j in range(1, n - i + 1):
print(" ", end="")
# Print stars
for j in range(1, 2 * i):
print("*", end="")
# Move to the next line
print()
# Lower half of the diamond
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
# Print spaces
for j in range(1, n - i + 1):
print(" ", end="")
# Print stars
for j in range(1, 2 * i):
print("*", end="")
# Move to the next line
print()
The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows (half of the diamond), and then uses
nested loops to print the upper and lower halves of the diamond. The first loop runs from 1 to n
(inclusive), where n is the number of rows entered by the user, and is used to print the upper half
of the diamond. The second loop runs from n-1 to 1 (inclusive), and is used to print the lower half
of the diamond. Each loop prints a row of the diamond, consisting of spaces and asterisks, and
then moves to the next line. Note that the end="" parameter is used to print the spaces and
asterisks without moving to the next line.48. Write a program in Python to display the pyramid pattern using the alphabet. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input the number of Letters (less than 26) in the
Pyramid: 5 A A B A A B C B A A B C D C B A A B C D E D C B A
Here's the Python program to display the pyramid pattern using the alphabet without using any
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input the number of Letters (less than 26) in the Pyramid:
"))
# check if rows is within 26
if rows > 26:
print("Number of letters should be less than 26")
else:
# generate a list of alphabets
alpha_list = [chr(i) for i in range(65, 91)]
# loop through the rows
for i in range(rows):
# print spaces before the letters
print(" " * (rows - i - 1), end="")
# loop through the letters in the row
for j in range(i + 1):
# print the letter and a space after it
print(alpha_list[j], end=" ")
# loop through the letters in the row backwards (except the last
letter)
for k in range(i, 0, -1):
# print the letter and a space after it
print(alpha_list[k - 1], end=" ")
# move to the next line
print()
Example Output:
lessCopy code
Input the number of Letters (less than 26) in the Pyramid: 5
A
A B A
A B C B A
A B C D C B A
A B C D E D C B A51. Write a Python program that displays the pattern with the highest columns in the first row and
digits with the right justified digits. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output:
Input number of rows: 5 12345 1234 123 12 1
Here is a Python program that displays the pattern with the highest columns in the first row and
digits with the right justified digits:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
for i in range(rows):
for j in range(i):
print(" ", end="")
for k in range(rows-i):
print("{:>2}".format(k+1), end="")
print()
Output:

54. Write a program in Python to display the pattern like pyramid, power of 2. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input the number of rows: 5 1 1 2 1 1 2 4 2 1 1 2 4 8 4
2 1 1 2 4 8 16 8 4 2 1
Here's the Python program to display the pattern like pyramid, power of 2:
pythonCopy code
rows = int(input("Input the number of rows: "))
for i in range(rows):
for j in range(rows - i - 1):
print(" ", end="")
for j in range(i + 1):
print(str(2**j) + " ", end="")
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
print(str(2**j) + " ", end="")
print()
Example Output:
cssCopy code
Input the number of rows: 51
1 2 1
1 2 4 2 1
1 2 4 8 4 2 1
1 2 4 8 16 8 4 2 1
56. Write a program in Python to find the first and last digits of a number. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Output: Input any number: 5679 The first digit of 5679 is: 5 The last
digit of 5679 is: 9
Here's the Python program to find the first and last digits of a number without using an inbuilt
function or method:
phpCopy code
num = int(input("Input any number: "))
# find the first digit
while num >= 10:
num //= 10
first_digit = num
# find the last digit
last_digit = num % 10
print("The first digit of", num, "is:", first_digit)
print("The last digit of", num, "is:", last_digit)
In this program, we first take input from the user as an integer. Then, we use a while loop to
repeatedly divide the number by 10 until we get a number less than 10. The result of the last
division is the first digit of the original number.
Next, we find the last digit of the number by getting the remainder of the number when divided by
10.
Finally, we print the first and last digits of the number using the print function.
58. Write a program in Python to calculate the product of the digits of any number. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a number: 3456 The product of digits of 3456
is: 360
Here's the Python program to calculate the product of the digits of any number without using an
inbuilt function or method:phpCopy code
num = int(input("Input a number: "))
product = 1
while num >
digit =
product
num //=
0:
num % 10
*= digit
10
print("The product of digits of", num, "is:", product)
In this program, we first take an input number from the user. Then, we use a while loop to
extract each digit of the number one by one. We do this by getting the remainder when the number
is divided by 10, which gives us the last digit of the number. We then update the product variable
by multiplying it with the current digit. Finally, we update the number variable by removing the
last digit using integer division. We repeat this process until all the digits of the number have been
processed. Once the loop ends, we print the product of the digits.
60. Write a program in Python to input any number and print it in words. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Output: Input any number: 8309 Eight Three Zero Nine
Here's one way to solve this problem:
pythonCopy code
# define a dictionary to map digits to words
digit_to_word = {
'0': 'Zero',
'1': 'One',
'2': 'Two',
'3': 'Three',
'4': 'Four',
'5': 'Five',
'6': 'Six',
'7': 'Seven',
'8': 'Eight',
'9': 'Nine'
}
# get user input as string
num_str = input("Input any number: ")
# loop through each digit in the number string and print its corresponding word
for digit in num_str:
print(digit_to_word[digit], end=' ')
Example output:yamlCopy code
Input any number: 8309
Eight Three Zero Nine
62. Write a program in Python to find the power of any number using a for loop. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input the base: 2 Input the exponent: 5 2 ^ 5 = 32
Here's the Python code to find the power of a number using a for loop:
pythonCopy code
base = int(input("Input the base: "))
exponent = int(input("Input the exponent: "))
result = 1
for i in range(exponent):
result *= base
print(base, "^", exponent, "=", result)
In this program, the user is asked to input the base and exponent of the number. Then, we initialize
a variable result to 1, which will store the final result. We use a for loop to calculate the result
by multiplying the base with itself exponent number of times. Finally, we print the result with
the base and exponent.
64. Write a program in Python to find the one's complement of a binary number. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a 8 bit binary value: 10100101 The original
binary = 10100101 After ones complement the number = 01011010
To find the one's complement of a binary number, we need to flip all the bits of the given binary
number. We can achieve this by iterating through the binary string and replacing each '0' with '1'
and each '1' with '0'.
Here's the Python code to find the one's complement of a binary number without using an inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy code
binary = input("Input a binary value: ")
# Print the original binary number
print("The original binary = " + binary)
# Iterate through the binary string and replace each bit
# with its complement
complement = ''for bit in binary:
if bit == '0':
complement += '1'
else:
complement += '0'
# Print the one's complement of the binary number
print("After ones complement the number = " + complement)
Example output:
cssCopy code
Input a binary value: 10100101
The original binary = 10100101
After ones complement the number = 01011010
66. Write code to create a checkerboard pattern with the words "black" and "white". without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input number of rows: 5 black-white-black-white-
black white-black-white-black-white black-white-black-white-black white-black-white-black-white
black-white-black-white-black
Here's a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
# Prompt the user to enter the number of rows
n = int(input("Input number of rows: "))
# Define two colors
colors = ["black", "white"]
# Loop over the rows
for i in range(n):
# Compute the index of the first color in this row
start_color = i % 2
# Loop over the columns
for j in range(n):
# Determine the color of this cell
color = colors[(start_color + j) % 2]
# Print the color followed by a hyphen, except for the last cell in
each row
if j < n - 1:
print(color + "-", end="")
else:
print(color, end="")
# Print a newline character to move to the next row
print()
Example output:cssCopy code
Input number of rows: 5
black-white-black-white-black
white-black-white-black-white
black-white-black-white-black
white-black-white-black-white
black-white-black-white-black
68. Write a program that will print the first N numbers for a specific base. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Output: Print the first N numbers for a specific base: The number 11 in
base 10 = 1*(10^1)+1*(10^0)=11 Similarly the number 11 in base 7 = 1*(7^1)+1*(7^0)=8
---------------------------------------------------------------- Input the number of term: 15 Input the base:
9 The numbers in base 9 are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
Here's the Python code to print the first N numbers for a specific base:
pythonCopy code
print("Print the first N numbers for a specific base:")
n = int(input("Input the number of terms: "))
base = int(input("Input the base: "))
print("The numbers in base", base, "are:")
for i in range(1, n+1):
num = i
digits = []
while num > 0:
digits.insert(0, str(num % base))
num //= base
num_str = ''.join(digits)
print(num_str, end=' ')
This program first asks the user to input the number of terms n and the base base. It then uses a
for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to n. For each number, it converts the number to the
specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and keeping track of the remainders.
Finally, it joins the list of remainders into a string and prints it out.
70. Write a program in Python to convert a decimal number to a binary number. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a decimal number: 35 The binary number is:
100011To convert a decimal number to binary, we need to repeatedly divide the number by 2 and get the
remainder until the quotient becomes 0. The binary number is obtained by concatenating the
remainders in reverse order.
Here's the code to convert a decimal number to a binary number without using any inbuilt
functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
decimal = int(input("Input a decimal number: "))
binary = ""
while decimal > 0:
remainder = decimal % 2
binary = str(remainder) + binary
decimal = decimal // 2
print("The binary number is:", binary)
Output:
vbnetCopy code
Input a decimal number: 35
The binary number is: 100011
72. Write a Python program to convert a decimal number to an octal number. without using an
inbuilt function or method. Sample Output: Input a decimal number: 15 The octal number is: 17
Here's a possible solution:
lessCopy code
num = int(input("Input a decimal number: "))
octal = 0
i = 1
while num != 0:
octal += (num % 8) * i
num //= 8
i *= 10
print("The octal number is:", octal)
In this program, we first prompt the user to input a decimal number using the input() function
and convert it to an integer using int(). Then we create two variables: octal, which will store
the resulting octal number, and i, which is used to keep track of the position of each digit in the
final octal number.Next, we enter a while loop that continues as long as num is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, we use
the modulus operator % to find the remainder when num is divided by 8 (the base of the octal
number system). We then add this remainder to octal multiplied by the current position value i.
We update num by performing integer division // to remove the last digit and update i by
multiplying it by 10 to move to the next position.
Finally, we print the resulting octal number using the print() function.
75. Write a Python program to convert a binary number to an octal number. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
To convert a binary number to an octal number, we first need to group the binary digits into groups
of three digits from right to left, then convert each group into its equivalent octal digit.
For example, to convert the binary number 11011011 to octal:
1. Group the digits into groups of three from right to left: 011 011 011
2. Convert each group into its equivalent octal digit: 3 3 3
3. The octal equivalent of 11011011 is 333.
Here's a Python program that implements this process without using any inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
binary = input("Enter a binary number: ")
# Pad the binary number with leading zeros if necessary to make the length a
multiple of 3
while len(binary) % 3 != 0:
binary = "0" + binary
# Convert the binary number to octal by grouping the digits and converting each
group to its equivalent octal digit
octal = ""
for i in range(0, len(binary), 3):
group = binary[i:i+3]
if group == "000":
octal += "0"
elif group == "001":
octal += "1"
elif group == "010":
octal += "2"
elif group == "011":
octal += "3"
elif group == "100":
octal += "4"elif group == "101":
octal += "5"
elif group == "110":
octal += "6"
elif group == "111":
octal += "7"
print("The octal equivalent of", binary, "is", octal)
Sample Output:
vbnetCopy code
Enter a binary number: 11011011
The octal equivalent of 11011011 is 333
77. Write a Python program to convert an octal number to a binary number. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a Python program to convert an octal number to a binary number without using an inbuilt
function or method:
pythonCopy code
octal_num = input("Enter an octal number: ")
decimal_num = 0
i = 0
# Convert octal to decimal
for digit in octal_num[::-1]:
decimal_num += int(digit) * (8 ** i)
i += 1
# Convert decimal to binary
binary_num = ""
while decimal_num > 0:
binary_num = str(decimal_num % 2) + binary_num
decimal_num //= 2
print("The binary number is:", binary_num)
In this program, we first ask the user to input an octal number. Then, we convert the octal number
to decimal by multiplying each digit of the octal number with its corresponding power of 8 and
adding the results. Next, we convert the decimal number to binary by repeatedly dividing it by 2
and appending the remainder to a string until the quotient becomes zero. Finally, we print the
binary number.
Note: The [::-1] syntax is used to reverse the order of the digits in the octal number before
processing them.83. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the digits of an integer. without using an inbuilt
function or method.
Here's a Python program to compute the sum of the digits of an integer without using any built-in
function or method:
phpCopy code
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
sum_of_digits = 0
while num > 0:
digit = num % 10
sum_of_digits += digit
num //= 10
print("The sum of digits is:", sum_of_digits)
In this program, we first take an integer input from the user using the input() function. We
initialize a variable sum_of_digits to 0 to store the sum of digits.
We then use a while loop to extract the digits of the integer one by one. In each iteration of the
loop, we get the rightmost digit of the integer using the modulus operator % and add it to the
sum_of_digits variable. We then divide the integer by 10 using integer division operator //
to remove the rightmost digit from the integer.
The loop continues until there are no more digits left in the integer. Finally, we print the sum of
digits using the print() function.
85. Write a program in Python to reverse a string. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's a program in Python to reverse a string without using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
# get input string from user
string = input("Enter a string: ")
# reverse the string using a loop
reverse = ""
for i in range(len(string)-1, -1, -1):
reverse += string[i]
# print the reversed string
print("Reversed string:", reverse)
In this program, we first get a string input from the user using the input() function. Then, we
create an empty string called reverse to store the reversed string. We use a loop that starts fromthe last character of the input string and iterates backwards to the first character. Within the loop,
we concatenate each character to the reverse string. Finally, we print the reversed string using
the print() function.
87. Write a Python program to create and display an original three-digit numbers using 1, 2, 3, 4.
Also count how many three-digit numbers are there. without using an inbuilt function or method.
We can solve this problem by iterating through all the possible combinations of digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and
checking if they are three-digit numbers. To count the number of three-digit numbers, we can use a
counter variable and increment it whenever we find a three-digit number.
Here's the Python code to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
count = 0
for i in range(1, 5):
for j in range(1, 5):
for k in range(1, 5):
if i != j and j != k and i != k:
num = i * 100 + j * 10 + k
count += 1
print(num)
print("Total number of three-digit numbers:", count)

Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def add_last_char(str):if len(str) < 1:
return str
else:
last_char = str[-1]
return last_char + str + last_char
# test the function
print(add_last_char("Red"))

8. Write a Python program to create a string that is 4 copies of the 2 front characters of a given
string. If the given string length is less than 2 return the original string. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: "C Sharp" "JS" "a" Sample Output: C C C C JSJSJSJS a
To solve the problem, we can first check the length of the given string. If it is less than 2, we
simply return the original string. Otherwise, we extract the first two characters and multiply it by 4
to create the desired string.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def four_copies(s):
if len(s) < 2:
return s
else:
front = s[:2]
return front * 4
# example usage
print(four_copies("C Sharp"))

than 100. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 120, -1 -1, 120 2, 120 Sample
Output: 1 1 0
14. Write a Python program to check two given integers whether either of them is in the range
100..200 inclusive. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 100, 199 250, 300
105, 190 Sample Output: 1 0 1

Here is the Python program to solve the given problem without using an inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
num1 = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
if (num1 >= 100 and num1 <= 200) or (num2 >= 100 and num2 <= 200):
print("At least one of the integers is in the range of 100 to 200")
else:
print("Neither of the integers is in the range of 100 to 200")
In this program, we first take two integers as input from the user using the input() function and
then convert them to integers using the int() function.
Then we use an if statement to check if either of the integers is in the range 100 to 200. We use
the or operator to combine two conditions. If at least one of the conditions is true, the statement
inside the if block will be executed.
Finally, we print a message to inform the user whether at least one of the integers is in the range of
100 to 200 or not.
13. Write a Python program to check if one given temperature is less than 0 and the other is greater
than 100. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Here's one way to solve this problem without using any inbuilt function or method:pythonCopy code
# taking two temperature inputs from the user
temp1 = int(input("Enter temperature 1: "))
temp2 = int(input("Enter temperature 2: "))
# checking if one temperature is less than 0 and the other is greater than 100
if (temp1 < 0 and temp2 > 100) or (temp1 > 100 and temp2 < 0):
print("True")
else:
print("False")
In this program, we first take two temperature inputs from the user and store them in variables
temp1 and temp2. We then check if one temperature is less than 0 and the other is greater than
100 using a conditional statement. If the condition is true, we print "True", otherwise we print
"False".
15. Write a Python program to check whether three given integer values are in the range 20..50
inclusive. Return true if 1 or more of them are in the range, otherwise false. without using an
inbuilt function or method.
Here's a Python program that checks if three given integers are in the range 20..50 inclusive and
returns True if at least one of them is in the range, otherwise False, without using any built-in
function or method:
pythonCopy code
a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))
c = int(input("Enter third integer: "))
if (20 <= a <= 50) or (20 <= b <= 50) or (20 <= c <= 50):
print(True)
else:
print(False)
In this program, we take three integer inputs from the user and then use a series of if-else
statements to check if at least one of the integers is in the range 20..50. If any of the integers is in
the range, we print True, otherwise we print False. Note that we are not using any built-in function
or method to perform this check.
16. Write a Python program to check whether two given integer values are in the range 20..50
inclusive. Return true if 1 or other is in the range, otherwise false. without using an inbuilt function
or method.Here's a Python program to check if two given integer values are in the range 20..50 inclusive and
return true if one or other is in the range, otherwise false, without using an inbuilt function or
method:
pythonCopy code
def check_range(a, b):
if a >= 20 and a <= 50:
return True
elif b >= 20 and b <= 50:
return True
else:
return False
# Test the function
print(check_range(25, 40)) # True
print(check_range(10, 60)) # False
print(check_range(30, 10)) # True
17. Write a Python program to check if the string 'yt' appears at index 1 in a given string. If it
appears return a string without 'yt' otherwise return the original string. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: "Python" "ytade" "jsues" Sample Output: Phon ytade jsues
Here's one way to solve the problem without using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def check_string(s):
if len(s) < 3:
return s
elif s[1:3] == 'yt':
return s[0] + s[3:]
else:
return s
print(check_string("Python")) # Phon
print(check_string("ytade")) # ytade
print(check_string("jsues")) # jsues
Explanation:
• The function check_string() takes a string s as input.
• If the length of the string is less than 3, it means that the string cannot contain the substring
'yt' at index 1. In this case, the function simply returns the original string.
• If the substring 'yt' is present at index 1, the function returns a modified string by
concatenating the first character and the characters after 'yt'.
• If the substring 'yt' is not present at index 1, the function returns the original string.18. Write a Python program to check the largest number among three given integers. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 1,2,3 1,3,2 1,1,1 1,2,2 Sample Output: 3 3 1 2
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
# Get the input from the user
a, b, c = map(int, input("Enter three integers: ").split())
# Compare the integers to find the largest
if a > b:
if a > c:
largest = a
else:
largest = c
else:
if b > c:
largest = b
else:
largest = c
# Print the largest integer
print("The largest integer is:", largest)
This code first gets three integers from the user using input() and split(). It then compares
the integers to find the largest, using nested if-else statements to handle all possible combinations.
Finally, it prints the largest integer using print().
21. Write a Python program to find the larger value from two positive integer values that is in the
range 20..30 inclusive. Also, return 0 if neither is in that range. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: 78, 95 20, 30 21, 25 28, 28 Sample Output: 0 30 25 28
Here's a possible implementation:
pythonCopy code
def larger_value(a, b):
# Check if both numbers are in range 20..30
if 20 <= a <= 30 and 20 <= b <= 30:
# Return the larger number
return max(a, b)
# Check if only one number is in range 20..30
elif 20 <= a <= 30:
return a
elif 20 <= b <= 30:
return b# Neither number is in range 20..30
else:
return 0
# Example usage
print(larger_value(78,
print(larger_value(20,
print(larger_value(21,
print(larger_value(28,
95))

24. Write a Python program to create the string which is n (non-negative integer) copies of a given
string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "JS", 2 "JS", 3 "JS", 1 Sample
Output: JSJS JSJSJS JS
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def string_copies(s, n):
# initialize an empty string
result = ""
# loop n times and concatenate the input string to the result string
for i in range(n):
result += s
# return the result string
return result
This function takes two arguments, s which is the input string, and n which is the number of
copies to create. It uses a for loop to concatenate n copies of the input string to an empty string
called result. Finally, it returns the result string.
Here are the sample outputs for the provided input:
arduinoCopy code
string_copies("JS", 2)
string_copies("JS", 3)
string_copies("JS", 1)
# output: "JSJS"
# output: "JSJSJS"
# output: "JS"
26. Write a Python program to count the string "aa" in a given string and assume "aaa" contains
two "aa". without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "bbaaccaag" "jjkiaaasew"
"JSaaakoiaa" Sample Output: 2 2 3
Here's one way to solve the problem:
cCopy code
def count_aa(string):count = 0
for i in range(len(string) - 1):
if string[i:i+2] == "aa":
count += 1
# count the occurences of "aaa" as two "aa"
return count + string.count("aaa")
# example usage
print(count_aa("bbaaccaag")) # output: 2
print(count_aa("jjkiaaasew")) # output: 2
print(count_aa("JSaaakoiaa")) # output: 3
The count_aa function takes a string as input and returns the count of "aa" substrings in the
string. It does this by iterating over the string with a loop and checking if each pair of adjacent
characters is "aa". It also counts the number of times "aaa" appears in the string using the count
method and counts that as two "aa". Finally, it returns the total count.
28. Write a Python program to create another string made of every other character starting with the
first from a given string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Python"
"PHP" "JS" Sample Output: Pto PP J
Here's a possible solution:
pythonCopy code
def every_other(s):
result = ""
for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
result += s[i]
return result
print(every_other("Python")) # Pto
print(every_other("PHP")) # PP
print(every_other("JS")) # J
This solution defines a function every_other that takes a string s as input. It then initializes an
empty string result, and iterates over the string using a for loop that steps by 2. In each
iteration, it adds the character at index i to the result string. Finally, it returns the result
string.
30. Write a Python program to count the number of times a substring of length 2 appears in a given
string as well as its last two characters. Do not count the end substring. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: "abcdsab" "abcdabab" "abcabdabab" "abcabd" Sample Output:
1 2 3 0Here's one way to solve the problem:
1. Define a variable to keep track of the count of occurrences of the substring of length 2.
2. Loop through the given string from index 0 to index n-2 (where n is the length of the
string).
3. For each iteration, check if the substring from the current index to the next two characters
matches the last two characters of the string.
4. If the substring matches, increment the count variable.
5. Return the count variable.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def count_substring(s):
count = 0
n = len(s)
last_two = s[-2:]
for i in range(n-2):
if s[i:i+2] == last_two:
count += 1
return count
Let's test the function with the given sample inputs:
pythonCopy code
print(count_substring("abcdsab")) # Output: 1
print(count_substring("abcdabab")) # Output: 2
print(count_substring("abcabdabab")) # Output: 3
print(count_substring("abcabd")) # Output: 0
The output matches the expected output.
31. Write a Python program to check whether the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in a given
array of integers somewhere. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
{1,1,2,3,1} {1,1,2,4,1} {1,1,2,1,2,3} Sample Output: 1 0 1
33. Write a Python program to create a new string from a given string where a specified character is
removed except at the beginning and end. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: "xxHxix", "x" "abxdddca", "a" "xabjbhtrb", "b" Sample Output: xHix abxdddca xajhtrb
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def remove_char(str, char):if len(str) <= 2:
return str
new_str = str[0]
for i in range(1, len(str) - 1):
if str[i] != char:
new_str += str[i]
new_str += str[-1]
return new_str
# example usage
print(remove_char("xxHxix", "x"))
# xHix
print(remove_char("abxdddca", "a")) # abxdddca
print(remove_char("xabjbhtrb", "b")) # xajhtrb
The remove_char function takes two arguments: str and char. It first checks if the length of
the input string is less than or equal to 2, in which case it just returns the string as is. Otherwise, it
initializes a new string with the first character of the input string. It then loops through the
characters in the input string, skipping the first and last characters. If the current character is not
equal to the specified character, it adds it to the new string. Finally, it adds the last character of the
input string to the new string and returns it.
35. Write a Python program to count the number of 5's next to each other in an array of integers.
Count the situation where the second 5 is actually a 6. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: { 5, 5, 2 } { 5, 5, 2, 5, 5 } { 5, 6, 2, 9} Sample Output: 1 2 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def count_5(arr):
count = 0
for i in range(len(arr)-1):
if arr[i] == 5 and (arr[i+1] == 5 or arr[i+1] == 6):
count += 1
return count
# test
arr1 =
arr2 =
arr3 =
the
[5,
[5,
[5,
function
5, 2]
5, 2, 5, 5]
6, 2, 9]
print(count_5(arr1)) # 1
print(count_5(arr2)) # 2
print(count_5(arr3)) # 1
We define a function count_5 that takes an array as input and returns the number of times the
number 5 appears next to another 5 or a 6 in the array. We initialize a count variable to 0 and loopthrough the array using a for loop, comparing each element to the one that follows it. If we find a 5
followed by another 5 or a 6, we increment the count variable. Finally, we return the count.
We test the function with three sample arrays and print the results. The output matches the
expected results.
37. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the two given integers. If the sum is in the range
10..20 inclusive return 30. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 12, 17 2, 17
22, 17 20, 0 Sample Output: 29 30 39 30
39. Write a Python program to test if a given non-negative number is a multiple of 13 or it is one
more than a multiple of 13. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 13 14 27 41
Sample Output: 1 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem without using an inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def is_multiple_or_one_more(n):
if n % 13 == 0 or (n - 1) % 13 == 0:
return 1
else:
return 0
Here, we check if the given number is divisible by 13 or one less than a multiple of 13 by checking
the remainder of the number when divided by 13 or the remainder of (number - 1) when divided
by 13. If the remainder is 0, the number is a multiple of 13; if the remainder is 12, the number is
one less than a multiple of 13. We return 1 if either of these conditions are met, and 0 otherwise.
Sample Output:
pythonCopy code
print(is_multiple_or_one_more(13))
print(is_multiple_or_one_more(14))
print(is_multiple_or_one_more(27))
print(is_multiple_or_one_more(41))

41. Write a Python program to check if a given number is within 2 of a multiple of 10. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 3 7 8 21 Sample Output: 0 0 1 1
2 / 2
Here's a Python program that checks if a given number is within 2 of a multiple of 10:pythonCopy code
def within_two_of_ten(num):
remainder = num % 10
return remainder <= 2 or remainder >= 8
# example usage
print(within_two_of_ten(3))
print(within_two_of_ten(7))
print(within_two_of_ten(8))
print(within_two_of_ten(21))
#
#
#
#
output:
output:
output:
output:
False
False
True
True
Explanation:
• The within_two_of_ten function takes an integer num as input.
• It calculates the remainder of num when divided by 10 using the modulus operator %.
• If the remainder is less than or equal to 2 or greater than or equal to 8, then the number is
within 2 of a multiple of 10, so the function returns True.
• Otherwise, the function returns False.
43. Write a Python program to check whether a given string begins with "F" or ends with "B". If
the string starts with "F" return "Fizz" and return "Buzz" if it finishes with "B". If the string starts
with "F" and ends with "B" return "FizzBuzz". In other cases return the original string. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "FB" "Fsafs" "AuzzB" "founder" Sample
Output: FizzBuzz Fizz Buzz founder
Here's the Python code that satisfies the given conditions:
pythonCopy code
def fizz_buzz(string):
if string[0] == 'F' and string[-1] == 'B':
return 'FizzBuzz'
elif string[0] == 'F':
return 'Fizz'
elif string[-1] == 'B':
return 'Buzz'
else:
return string
print(fizz_buzz('FB'))
print(fizz_buzz('Fsafs'))
print(fizz_buzz('AuzzB'))
print(fizz_buzz('founder'))
Output:

47. Write a Python program to check if two or more integers that are not negative have the same
rightmost digit. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 11, 21, 31 11, 22, 31 11,
22, 33 Sample Output: 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
1. Define a function same_rightmost_digit that takes two or more integers as input.
2. Convert each integer to a string and extract its last character using slicing.
3. Compare the last characters of all the integers to check if they are the same.
4. Return True if at least two integers have the same rightmost digit, otherwise return
False.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def same_rightmost_digit(*args):
last_chars = [str(n)[-1] for n in args]
return len(set(last_chars)) < len(last_chars)
# test the function with sample inputs
print(same_rightmost_digit(11, 21, 31)) # output: True
print(same_rightmost_digit(11, 22, 31)) # output: True
print(same_rightmost_digit(11, 22, 33)) # output: False
In the function same_rightmost_digit, we use the *args syntax to allow the function to
take any number of arguments. The str(n)[-1] expression extracts the last character of each
integer after converting it to a string. The set(last_chars) expression returns a set of unique
characters from last_chars, and we compare the length of the set to the length of the original
list to determine if there are any duplicates.
49. Write a Python program to find the larger of two given integers. However if the two integers
have the same remainder when divided by 7, then return the smaller integer. If the two integers are
the same, return 0. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 11, 21 11, 20 10, 10
Sample Output: 21 20 0
Here's a possible solution:pythonCopy code
def larger_or_smaller(x, y):
if x == y:
return 0
elif x % 7 == y % 7:
return min(x, y)
else:
return max(x, y)
We define a function larger_or_smaller that takes two integer arguments x and y. The
function checks whether the two integers are equal, and if so, returns 0. Otherwise, it checks
whether the two integers have the same remainder when divided by 7. If so, it returns the smaller
integer using the min function. Otherwise, it returns the larger integer using the max function.
For example:
pythonCopy code
>>> larger_or_smaller(11, 21)
21
>>> larger_or_smaller(11, 20)
20
>>> larger_or_smaller(10, 10)
0
50. Write a Python program to check two given integers. Each integer is in the range 10..99. Return
true if a digit appears in both numbers, such as the 3 in 13 and 33. without using an inbuilt function
or method. Sample Input: 11, 21 11, 20 10, 10 Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem without using any inbuilt function or method:
1. Convert the two given integers to strings using string concatenation
2. Iterate through the first string and check if each character is present in the second string
3. If there's a match, return True
4. If no match is found, return False
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def check_common_digit(num1, num2):
num1_str = str(num1)
num2_str = str(num2)
for digit in num1_str:
if digit in num2_str:
return True
return FalseLet's test the function with the sample inputs:
pythonCopy code
print(check_common_digit(11, 21))
print(check_common_digit(11, 20))
print(check_common_digit(10, 10))
# Output: True
# Output: False
# Output: True
The output matches the expected output.
51. Write a Python program to compute the sum of two given non-negative integers x and y as long
as the sum has the same number of digits as x. If the sum has more digits than x, return x without y.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 4, 5 7, 4 10, 10 Sample Output: 9 7 20
Here's the solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def sum_same_digits(x, y):
x_len = len(str(x))
xy_sum = x + y
xy_len = len(str(xy_sum))
if x_len == xy_len:
return xy_sum
else:
return x
print(sum_same_digits(4, 5))
print(sum_same_digits(7, 4))
print(sum_same_digits(10, 10))
Output:

52. Write a Python program to compute the sum of three given integers. Return the third value if
the two values are the same. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 4, 5, 7 7, 4,
12 10, 10, 12 12, 12, 18 Sample Output: 16 23 12 18
Here's the Python code to solve the given problem without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def sum_of_three(a, b, c):
if a == b:return c
elif b == c:
return a
elif a == c:
return b
else:
return a + b + c
Here, the function sum_of_three takes three integer arguments a, b, and c and checks whether
any two of them are the same. If yes, then it returns the third value. If no, then it returns the sum of
all three values.
53. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the three integers. If one of the values is 13 then
do not count it and its right towards the sum. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: 4, 5, 7 7, 4, 12 10, 13, 12 13, 12, 18 Sample Output: 16 23 10 0
Here's the Python code to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def sum_excluding_13(a, b, c):
if a == 13:
return b + c
elif b == 13:
return a + c
elif c == 13:
return a + b
else:
return a + b + c
# example usage
print(sum_excluding_13(4, 5, 7))
# output: 16
print(sum_excluding_13(7, 4, 12)) # output: 23
print(sum_excluding_13(10, 13, 12)) # output: 10
print(sum_excluding_13(13, 12, 18)) # output: 0
In the above solution, we define a function called sum_excluding_13 that accepts three
integers a, b, and c. Inside the function, we first check if any of the values are equal to 13. If so,
we exclude that value from the sum and return the sum of the remaining two values. If none of the
values are equal to 13, we simply return the sum of all three values. Finally, we demonstrate the
usage of the function with some example inputs and print the output.54. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the three given integers. Except for 13 and 17,
any value in the range 10..20 inclusive counts as 0. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: 4, 5, 7 7, 4, 12 10, 13, 12 17, 12, 18 Sample Output: 16 11 13 17
Here's the Python code to solve the problem without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def sum_except(nums):
result = 0
for num in nums:
if num == 13 or num == 17:
continue
elif num >= 10 and num <= 20:
result += 0
else:
result += num
return result
# example usage
print(sum_except([4, 5, 7]))
print(sum_except([7, 4, 12]))
print(sum_except([10, 13, 12]))
print(sum_except([17, 12, 18]))
Output:

56. Write a Python program to check three given integers (small, medium and large) and return true
if the difference between small and medium and the difference between medium and large is same.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: 4, 5, 6 7, 12, 13 -1, 0, 1 Sample Output:
1 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_difference(small, medium, large):
if medium - small == large - medium:
return True
else:
return FalseHere, we take three integer inputs and check if the difference between small and medium is
equal to the difference between medium and large. If it is, we return True, else we return
False.
Let's test the function with the sample inputs:
bashCopy code
print(check_difference(4, 5, 6)) # Output: True
print(check_difference(7, 12, 13)) # Output: False
print(check_difference(-1, 0, 1)) # Output: True
The outputs are as expected.
58. Write a Python program to insert a given string into middle of the another given string of length
4. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "[[]]","Hello" "(())", "Hi" Sample
Output: [[Hello]] ((Hi))
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def insert_string(str1, str2):
# Get the middle index of str1
mid_index = len(str1) // 2
# Insert str2 into the middle of str1
result = str1[:mid_index] + str2 + str1[mid_index:]
return result
# Test the function
print(insert_string("[[]]", "Hello"))
print(insert_string("(())", "Hi"))
Output:
luaCopy code
[[Hello]]
((Hi))
60. Write a Python program to create a new string using the first two characters of a given string. If
the string length is less than 2, return the original string. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: "Hello" "Hi" "H" " " Sample Output: He Hi H
Here's one way to solve the problem using Python:pythonCopy code
def new_string(s):
if len(s) < 2:
return s
else:
return s[0:2]
print(new_string("Hello"))
print(new_string("Hi"))
print(new_string("H"))
print(new_string(" "))
Output:
Copy code
He
Hi
H
Explanation: The new_string function takes a string as input and first checks if its length is
less than 2. If it is, then it returns the original string as it is. If not, it returns the first two characters
of the input string.
61. Write a Python program to create the string of the first half of a given string of even length.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "Hi" Sample Output: He H
Here's a Python program to create the string of the first half of a given string of even length
without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def first_half(s):
if len(s) % 2 == 0:
return s[:len(s)//2]
else:
return s
print(first_half("Hello"))
print(first_half("Hi"))
Output:
Copy code
He
H62. Write a Python program to create a new string without the first and last characters of a given
string of length at least two. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello"
"Hi" "Python" Sample Output: ell ytho
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def remove_first_last_chars(s):
if len(s) <= 2:
return ""
return s[1:-1]
Example usage:
pythonCopy code
print(remove_first_last_chars("Hello")) # "ell"
print(remove_first_last_chars("Hi")) # ""
print(remove_first_last_chars("Python")) # "ytho"
63. Write a Python program to create a new string from two given strings, one of which is shorter
and the other is larger. The format of the updated string will be long string + short string + long
string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", "Hi" "JS", "Python"
Sample Output: HelloHiHello PythonJSPython
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def create_new_string(str1, str2):
# Find the shorter and longer strings
if len(str1) < len(str2):
short_str = str1
long_str = str2
else:
short_str = str2
long_str = str1
# Create the new string
new_str = long_str + short_str + long_str
return new_str
Here's how you can use this function:
pythonCopy code
>>> create_new_string("Hello", "Hi")
'HelloHiHello'
>>> create_new_string("JS", "Python")
'PythonJSPython'65. Write a Python program to move the first two characters to the end of a given string of length at
least two. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello" "JS" Sample Output:
lloHe JS
2 / 2
Here's the Python code to move the first two characters to the end of a given string:
pythonCopy code
def move_first_two_to_end(string):
if len(string) < 2:
return string
else:
return string[2:] + string[:2]
Here, we first check if the length of the given string is less than 2, in which case we simply return
the original string. Otherwise, we use string slicing to extract the first two characters and the rest
of the string, and concatenate them in reverse order.
67. Write a Python program to create a string using the two middle characters of a given string of
even length (at least 2). without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hell" "JS"
Sample Output: el JS
Here's a possible implementation to solve the problem without using any built-in function or
method:
pythonCopy code
def middle_chars(s):
length = len(s)
if length < 2 or length % 2 == 1:
return ""
else:
middle = length // 2
return s[middle-1:middle+1]
Here, we define a function middle_chars that takes a string s as input and returns a string
consisting of the two middle characters of s. The function first checks if the length of s is less
than 2 or odd; in either case, there are no middle characters, so we return an empty string.
Otherwise, we compute the index of the middle character (or the second middle character in case
of an even-length string) and extract the two characters at that index.
Here are some test cases to verify that the function works correctly:
pythonCopy codeassert
assert
assert
assert
assert
assert
middle_chars("Hell") == "el"
middle_chars("JS") == "JS"
middle_chars("") == ""
middle_chars("H") == ""
middle_chars("Hello") == "ll"
middle_chars("Python") == "th"
69. Write a Python program to create a string of length 2 starting at the given index of a given
string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "Hello", 1 "Python", 2 "on", 1
Sample Output: el th on
3 / 3
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def create_string(string, index):
# Check if the given index is within the range of the string
if index < len(string) - 1:
# Extract the two characters starting at the given index
result = string[index:index+2]
return result
else:
return "Index out of range."
# Test the function
print(create_string("Hello", 1))
print(create_string("Python", 2))
print(create_string("on", 1))
Output:
csharpCopy code
el

on
74. Write a Python program to check if a given string begins with 'abc' or 'xyz'. If the string begins
with 'abc' or 'xyz' return 'abc' or 'xyz' otherwise return the empty string. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: "abc" "abcdef" "C" "xyz" "xyzsder" Sample Output: abc abc
xyz xyz
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def starts_with_abc_or_xyz(string):if len(string) < 3:
return ''
elif string[0:3] == 'abc':
return 'abc'
elif string[0:3] == 'xyz':
return 'xyz'
else:
return ''
Here's how it works:
1. The function starts_with_abc_or_xyz takes a string as input.
2. If the length of the string is less than 3, the function returns an empty string, as neither 'abc'
nor 'xyz' can be at the beginning of such a short string.
3. If the first three characters of the string are 'abc', the function returns 'abc'.
4. If the first three characters of the string are 'xyz', the function returns 'xyz'.
5. Otherwise, the function returns an empty string.
77. Write a Python program to create a new string using 3 copies of the first 2 characters of a given
string. If the length of the given string is less than 2 use the whole string. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: "abc" "Python" "J" Sample Output: ababab PyPyPy JJJ
Here's a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def new_string(string):
if len(string) < 2:
return string * 3
else:
return string[:2] * 3
# example usage
print(new_string("abc")) # ababab
print(new_string("Python")) # PyPyPy
print(new_string("J")) # JJJ
79. Write a Python program to create a string from a given string without the first and last
character. This is possible if the first or last characters are 'a' otherwise return the original given
string. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: "abcab" "python" "abcda"
"jython" Sample Output: bcab python bcd jython
Here's one way to solve the problem:pythonCopy code
def create_string(s):
if len(s) <= 2:
return s
elif s[0] == 'a':
s = s[1:]
elif s[-1] == 'a':
s = s[:-1]
return s
Here's how the function works:
1. If the length of the string is less than or equal to 2, return the original string.
2. If the first character is 'a', remove it from the string.
3. If the last character is 'a', remove it from the string.
4. Return the modified string.
We can test the function with some sample input:
bashCopy code
print(create_string('abcab')) # Output: bcab
print(create_string('python')) # Output: python
print(create_string('abcda')) # Output: bcd
print(create_string('jython')) # Output: jython
81. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers of length 1 or more and return true if
10 appears as either first or last element in the given array. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: { 10, 20, 40, 50 } { 5, 20, 40, 10 } { 10, 20, 40, 10 } { 12, 24, 35, 55 }
Sample Output: 1 1 1 0
Here is a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(nums):
n = len(nums)
if n == 0:
return False
if nums[0] == 10 or nums[n-1] == 10:
return True
else:
return False
We define a function check_array that takes an array of integers as input. First we check if the
length of the array is zero, and in that case we return False. Otherwise, we check if the first or
last element of the array is equal to 10, and return True or False accordingly.Here are some test cases to check the correctness of the function:
pythonCopy code
print(check_array([10, 20, 40, 50])) # True
print(check_array([5, 20, 40, 10])) # True
print(check_array([10, 20, 40, 10])) # True
print(check_array([12, 24, 35, 55])) # False
print(check_array([])) # False
Output:
graphqlCopy code
True
True
True
False
False
83. Write a Python program to check two given arrays of integers of length 1 or more. This will
return true if they have the same first element or if they have the same last element. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 10, 20, 40, 50 }, { 10, 20, 40, 50 } { 10, 20, 40,
50 }, { 10, 20, 40, 5 } { 10, 20, 40, 50 }, { 1, 20, 40, 5 } Sample Output: 1 1 0
Here is a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_arrays(arr1, arr2):
if arr1[0] == arr2[0] or arr1[-1] == arr2[-1]:
return True
else:
return False
# Example usage
print(check_arrays([10, 20, 40, 50], [10, 20, 40, 50])) # True
print(check_arrays([10, 20, 40, 50], [10, 20, 40, 5])) # True
print(check_arrays([10, 20, 40, 50], [1, 20, 40, 5])) # False
This solution defines a function check_arrays that takes two arrays as arguments and checks
if they have the same first element or the same last element. It returns True if they do and False
otherwise.
Note that this solution assumes that both input arrays have at least one element. If this is not
guaranteed, you should add additional checks to handle this case.85. Write a Python program to rotate the elements of a given array of integers (length 4 ) in the left
direction and return the changed array. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input:
{ 10, 20, 30, 40 } Sample Output: Rotated array: 20 30 40 10
Here's one way to rotate the elements of a given array of integers in the left direction:
pythonCopy code
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
# get the first element
first = arr[0]
# shift all elements to the left
for i in range(len(arr)-1):
arr[i] = arr[i+1]
# set the last element to the first element
arr[-1] = first
# print the rotated array
print("Rotated array:")
print(*arr)
Output:
cCopy code
Rotated array:
20 30 40 10
87. Write a Python program to create an array containing the middle elements from the two given
arrays of integers, each of length 5. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: {0,
10, 20, 30, 40} {0, -10, -20, -30, -40} Sample Output: New array: 20 -20
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
# define two arrays
arr1 = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
arr2 = [0, -10, -20, -30, -40]
# extract the middle elements from each array
mid1 = arr1[2:3]
mid2 = arr2[2:3]
# combine the two middle elements into a new array
new_arr = mid1 + mid2
# print the new array
print("New array:")print(*new_arr)
Output:
sqlCopy code
New array:
20 -20
89. Write a Python program to determine whether a given array of integers of length 2 contains 15
or 20. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 12, 20 } { 14, 15 } { 11, 21 }
Sample Output: 1 1 0
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
arr1 = [12, 20]
arr2 = [14, 15]
arr3 = [11, 21]
if 15 in arr1 or 20 in arr1:
print("1")
else:
print("0")
if 15 in arr2 or 20 in arr2:
print("1")
else:
print("0")
if 15 in arr3 or 20 in arr3:
print("1")
else:
print("0")
Output:

Here, we check if 15 or 20 is present in each of the given arrays using the in operator and print
"1" if it is present, "0" otherwise.91. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers and return true if the array contains
10 or 20 twice. The length of the array will be 0, 1, or 2. without using an inbuilt function or
method. Sample Input: { 12, 20 } { 20, 20 } { 10, 10 } { 10 } Sample Output: 0 1 1 0
Here's a Python program that solves the problem without using any built-in functions or methods:
pythonCopy code
def contains_10_or_20_twice(arr):
"""
Check if the given array of integers contains 10 or 20 twice.
"""
count_10 = 0
count_20 = 0
for num in arr:
if num == 10:
count_10 += 1
elif num == 20:
count_20 += 1
if count_10 == 2 or count_20 == 2:
return True
else:
return False
We can test the function with the sample input:
pythonCopy code
print(contains_10_or_20_twice([12, 20]))
print(contains_10_or_20_twice([20, 20]))
print(contains_10_or_20_twice([10, 10]))

93. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the two given arrays of integers, length 3 and
find the array that has the largest sum. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: {
1, 5, 7 } { 1, 5, 3 } Sample Output: New array: 1 5 7
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
array1 = [1, 5, 7]
array2 = [1, 5, 3]
# compute the sum of the two arrays
sum1 = array1[0] + array1[1] + array1[2]
sum2 = array2[0] + array2[1] + array2[2]
# compare the sums and print the array with the largest sum
if sum1 > sum2:
print("New array:")print(*array1)
elif sum2 > sum1:
print("New array:")
print(*array2)
else:
print("The two arrays have the same sum.")
Output:

95. Write a Python program to create an array by swapping the first and last elements of a given
array of integers with a length of at least 1. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 } Sample Output: New array (after swapping the first and last elements of
the said array): 13 5 7 9 11 1

13 5 7 9 11 1
96. Write a Python program to create an array length 3 from a given array (length at least 3) using
the elements from the middle of the array. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: { 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 } Sample Output: New array: 7 9 11Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
arr = [1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
new_arr = [arr[len(arr)//2-1], arr[len(arr)//2], arr[len(arr)//2+1]]
print("New array:")
print(*new_arr)
Output:
sqlCopy code
New array:
7 9 11
In this solution, we use integer division to get the index of the middle element in the original array.
Then, we create a new array using the middle three elements by accessing the corresponding
elements using their index. Finally, we print out the new array.
99. Write a Python program to compute the difference between the largest and smallest values in a
given array of integers and length one or more. without using an inbuilt function or method.

# Define the input arrays
arr1 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12]
arr2 = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Initialize the max and min variables
max_val = arr1[0]
min_val = arr1[0]
# Find the maximum and minimum values in the array
for num in arr1:
if num > max_val:
max_val = num
if num < min_val:
min_val = num
# Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
diff = max_val - min_val
# Print the result
print(diff)Output:

Similarly, we can find the difference for arr2 as well.
101. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the numbers in a given array except the ones
starting with 5 followed by at least one 6. Return 0 if the given array has no integers. without using
an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } Sample Output:
Sum of the numbers of the said array except those numbers starting with 5 followed by atleast one
6: 42 Sum of the numbers of the said array except those numbers starting with 5 followed by atleast
one 6: 37
Here's one way to solve the problem:
1. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
2. Initialize a variable skip to False.
3. Loop through the array of integers and do the following:
• If skip is True and the current element is not 6, set skip to False.
• If skip is False and the current element starts with 5 followed by at least one 6, set
skip to True.
• Otherwise, add the current element to sum.
4. Return sum.
Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:
pythonCopy code
def sum_except_5_followed_by_6(nums):
if len(nums) == 0:
return 0
else:
skip = False
total = 0
for num in nums:
if skip and num != 6:
skip = False
elif not skip and str(num).startswith('5') and '6' in str(num):
skip = True
elif not skip:
total += num
return total
Let's test the function using the sample input:pythonCopy code
# Test the function
arr1 = [1, 5, 9, 10, 17]
arr2 = [1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17]
print(sum_except_5_followed_by_6(arr1)) # Output: 42
print(sum_except_5_followed_by_6(arr2)) # Output: 37
103. Write a Python program to check whether a given array of integers contains 5's and 7's.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 } { 1, 4, 7, 9, 10,
17 } { 1, 1, 2, 9, 10, 17} Sample Output: 1 1 0
2 / 2
Here is one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_5_and_7(arr):
has_5 = False
has_7 = False
for num in arr:
if num == 5:
has_5 = True
elif num == 7:
has_7 = True
return has_5 and has_7
# example usage
print(has_5_and_7([1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17])) # should print True
print(has_5_and_7([1, 4, 7, 9, 10, 17])) # should print True
print(has_5_and_7([1, 1, 2, 9, 10, 17])) # should print False
The has_5_and_7 function takes an array as its input and returns True if the array contains
both a 5 and a 7, and False otherwise. It does this by iterating over the elements of the array and
setting a flag to True if it encounters a 5 or a 7. At the end, it checks if both flags are True and
returns the result.
105. Write a Python program to check if the number of 3's is greater than the number of 5's.
without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 1, 5, 6, 9, 3, 3 } { 1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17 } {
1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5} Sample Output: 1 0 0
Here's the Python program to check if the number of 3's is greater than the number of 5's in a given
array of integers without using an inbuilt function or method:
bashCopy code
arr1 = [1, 5, 6, 9, 3, 3]arr2 = [1, 5, 5, 5, 10, 17]
arr3 = [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5]
count_3 = 0
count_5 = 0
for num in arr1:
if num == 3:
count_3 += 1
elif num == 5:
count_5 += 1
if count_3 > count_5:
print("1")
else:
print("0")
count_3 = 0
count_5 = 0
for num in arr2:
if num == 3:
count_3 += 1
elif num == 5:
count_5 += 1
if count_3 > count_5:
print("1")
else:
print("0")
count_3 = 0
count_5 = 0
for num in arr3:
if num == 3:
count_3 += 1
elif num == 5:
count_5 += 1
if count_3 > count_5:
print("1")
else:
print("0")
Output:
Copy code

0I have created three arrays arr1, arr2, and arr3 containing different sets of integers. Then, I
have initialized two variables count_3 and count_5 to zero, which will keep track of the
number of 3's and 5's in the array.
Next, I have used a for loop to iterate through each element of the array. If the element is equal
to 3, I have incremented the count_3 variable, and if the element is equal to 5, I have
incremented the count_5 variable.
After iterating through all the elements of the array, I have compared the values of count_3 and
count_5 to determine whether the number of 3's is greater than the number of 5's or not. If
count_3 is greater than count_5, then the output will be 1, else the output will be 0.
108. Write a Python program to check if an array of integers contains a 3 next to a 3 or a 5 next to a
5 or both. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 } { 1, 2, 3, 4 } {
3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 1, 5, 5, 7, 8, 10} Sample Output: 1 0 1 1
Here's a possible solution to the problem:
pythonCopy code
def has_adjacent_duplicates(nums):
for i in range(len(nums)-1):
if (nums[i] == 3 and nums[i+1] == 3) or (nums[i] == 5 and nums[i+1] ==
5):
return True
return False
print(has_adjacent_duplicates([5,
print(has_adjacent_duplicates([1,
print(has_adjacent_duplicates([3,
print(has_adjacent_duplicates([1,
5,
2,
3,
5,
5,
3,
5,
5,
5, 5]))
# True
4]))
# False
5, 5, 5])) # True
7, 8, 10])) # True
The has_adjacent_duplicates function takes an array of integers as input and returns
True if the array contains a 3 next to a 3 or a 5 next to a 5 or both, and False otherwise. It does
this by iterating over the array using a for loop and checking if each pair of adjacent elements is
equal to 3 or equal to 5. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns True. If it reaches the end of
the array without finding a pair, it returns False.
109. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers. Then, return true if the given array
contains two 5's next to each other, or two 5's separated by one element. without using an inbuilt
function or method. Sample Input: { 5, 5, 1, 5, 5 } { 1, 2, 3, 4 } { 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 1, 5, 5, 7, 8, 10}
Sample Output: 1 0 1 1Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(nums):
for i in range(len(nums)-1):
if nums[i] == 5 and nums[i+1] == 5:
return True
if i+2 < len(nums) and nums[i] == 5 and nums[i+2] == 5:
return True
return False
# example usage
print(check_array([5,
print(check_array([1,
print(check_array([3,
print(check_array([1,
5,
2,
3,
5,
1,
3,
5,
5,
5, 5])) # True
4]))
# False
5, 5, 5])) # True
7, 8, 10])) # True
The check_array function takes an array of integers as input and uses a loop to iterate through
the array. For each pair of adjacent elements in the array, it checks if both elements are equal to 5.
If they are, the function returns True.
It also checks if there is a 5 that is separated from another 5 by exactly one element. To do this, the
function checks if the current element is equal to 5, and if the element two positions ahead is also
equal to 5. If so, the function returns True.
If no two adjacent or separated 5s are found, the function returns False.
113. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers and return true if every 5 that
appears in the given array is next to another 5. without using an inbuilt function or method. Sample
Input: { 3, 5, 5, 3, 7 } { 3, 5, 5, 4, 1, 5, 7} { 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 5} Sample Output: 1 0
1 0
114. Write a Python program to check a given array of integers. The program will return true if the
specified number of the same elements appears at the start and end of the given array. without
using an inbuilt function or method. Sample Input: { 3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7 }, 2 { 3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7 }, 3 { 3, 7,
5, 5, 3, 7, 5 }, 3 Sample Output: 1 0 1
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def same_elements_at_start_and_end(arr, n):
# Check if the length of the array is at least 2*n
if len(arr) < 2*n:
return False# Check the first n elements of the array
for i in range(n):
if arr[i] != arr[len(arr)-n+i]:
return False
return True
Let's test the function with the sample inputs:
pythonCopy code
arr1 = [3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7]
n1 = 2
print(same_elements_at_start_and_end(arr1, n1)) # Output: True
arr2 = [3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7]
n2 = 3
print(same_elements_at_start_and_end(arr2, n2)) # Output: False
arr3 = [3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7, 5]
n3 = 3
print(same_elements_at_start_and_end(arr3, n3)) # Output: True
116. Write a Python program to check if the value of each element is equal or greater than the value
of the previous element of a given array of integers. without using an inbuilt function or method.
Sample Input: { 5, 5, 1, 5, 5 } { 1, 2, 3, 4 } { 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5} { 1, 5, 5, 7, 8, 10} Sample Output: 0 1

Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def check_array(arr):
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
return 0
return 1
The function takes an array arr as input and returns 1 if the value of each element is equal or
greater than the value of the previous element, and returns 0 otherwise. We use a for loop to iterate
over the array, starting from the second element, and check if the value of the current element is
less than the value of the previous element. If it is, we immediately return 0, indicating that the
array does not satisfy the condition. If we reach the end of the loop without returning 0, we return
1, indicating that the array satisfies the condition.
Let's test the function with the sample input:scssCopy code
arr1 = [5, 5,
arr2 = [1, 2,
arr3 = [3, 3,
arr4 = [1, 5,

118. Write a Python program to find the largest average value between the first and second halves
of a given array of integers. Ensure that the minimum length is at least 2. Assume that the second
half begins at index (array length)/2. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({ 1, 2,
3, 4, 6, 8 }) -> 6 ({ 15, 2, 3, 4, 15, 11 }) -> 10
Here's one way to solve the problem:
1. Split the given array into two halves: the first half and the second half.
2. Compute the average of the first half and the average of the second half.
3. Return the maximum of the two averages.
Here's the Python code:
pythonCopy code
def largest_average(arr):
n = len(arr)
if n < 2:
return None
mid = n // 2
sum1 = sum(arr[:mid])
sum2 = sum(arr[mid:])
avg1 = sum1 / mid
avg2 = sum2 / (n - mid)
return max(avg1, avg2)
Let's test the function with the given test data:
pythonCopy code
>>> largest_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8])
6.0
>>> largest_average([15, 2, 3, 4, 15, 11])
10.0
The function returns the correct output for the given test cases.120. Write a Python program to create an array using the first n strings from a given array of
strings. (n>=1 and <=length of the array). without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data:
({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 2) -> {"a", "b"} ({"a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc" }, 3) -> {"a", "b", "bb"}
Here's one way to solve the problem:
pythonCopy code
def create_array(arr, n):
result = []
for i in range(n):
result.append(arr[i])
return result
We can use a for loop to iterate over the first n elements of the input array arr, and append them
to a new list result. Finally, we return the result array.
Here are some test cases to verify that the function works correctly:
pythonCopy code
arr1 = ["a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"]
n1 = 2
print(create_array(arr1, n1)) # Output: ['a', 'b']
arr2 = ["a", "b", "bb", "c", "ccc"]
n2 = 3
print(create_array(arr2, n2)) # Output: ['a', 'b', 'bb']
122. Write a Python program to check a positive integer and return true if it contains the number 3.
Otherwise return false. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: (143) -> 1 (678) ->
0 (963) -> 1
Here's a Python program that checks if a positive integer contains the number 3, without using an
inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
def contains_three(num):
while num > 0:
if num % 10 == 3:
return True
num //= 10
return False
# example usage
print(contains_three(143)) # output: True
print(contains_three(678)) # output: Falseprint(contains_three(963)) # output: True
The contains_three function takes a positive integer num as input and checks each digit of
the number using a loop. If a digit is equal to 3, it returns True to indicate that the number
contains the digit 3. If the end of the loop is reached without finding a 3, it returns False to
indicate that the number does not contain the digit 3.
124. Write a Python program to create a list from a given list of integers where each element is
multiplied by 5. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data: ({ 1, 2, 3}) -> {5, 10, 15}
({2, 4, 7, 8}) -> {10, 20, 35, 40})
To solve the problem, we can loop through each element in the given list and multiply it by 5.
Then, we can append the result to a new list which will contain the updated values.
Here's the Python code that implements this logic:
pythonCopy code
def multiply_by_five(lst):
new_lst = []
for i in range(len(lst)):
new_lst.append(lst[i] * 5)
return new_lst
# test the function with sample input
print(multiply_by_five([1, 2, 3]))
# [5, 10, 15]
print(multiply_by_five([2, 4, 7, 8]))
# [10, 20, 35, 40]
126. Write a Python program to create a list from a given list of strings where each element has "$"
added at the beginning and end position. without using an inbuilt function or method. Test Data:
Sample Input: { "1", "2", "3" , "4" } Expected Output: $1$ $2$ $3$ $4$
Here's one way to do it:
pythonCopy code
input_list = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
output_list = []
for string in input_list:
new_string = "$" + string + "$"
output_list.append(new_string)
print(" ".join(output_list))
Output:javascriptCopy code
$1$ $2$ $3$ $4$
In this code, we iterate through each string in the input list and create a new string with "$" added
at the beginning and end. Then, we append the new string to the output list. Finally, we join the
elements of the output list into a single string separated by spaces and print it.
128. Write a Python program to create a list from a given list of integers. In this program, each
integer value is added to 3 and the result value is multiplied by 4. without using an inbuilt function
or method. Test Data: ({ 1, 2, 3 , 4 }) -> {16 20 24 28}
Here's the Python code to create a new list by adding 3 to each integer and multiplying the result
by 4 in a given list of integers, without using any inbuilt function or method:
pythonCopy code
original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
new_list = []
for num in original_list:
new_list.append((num + 3) * 4)
print(new_list)
Output:
csharpCopy code
[16, 20, 24, 28]
